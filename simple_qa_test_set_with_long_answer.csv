Find sources:\xa0""The Oceanography Society""\xa0–\xa0news\xa0· newspapers\xa0· books\xa0· scholar\xa0· JSTOR (May 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message) The Oceanography Society (TOS) is a nonprofit society founded in 1988, based in Rockville, Maryland, U.S. and incorporated in the District of Columbia.[1] It is an oceanographical organization that aims to promote communication among oceanographers, spread knowledge through research and education, and to provide a constituency for building consensus amongst the sub-disciplines of the field. The society publishes the scientific journal Oceanography, which publishes articles on all oceanic disciplines.[2] History[edit] The idea for forming an oceanographic society was hatched by a group of scientists, who approached both the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society with the idea. The two groups both responded positively, leading to several oceanographic events at the time. However, the need developed for the creation of an independent community, resulting in the formation of the Oceanography Society in March 1988. These early developments by the society were paralleled by developments in the Challenger Society for Marine Science.[1] Awards[edit] The Oceanography Society gives out three awards—the Jerlov Award, the Walter Munk Medal, and the Oceanography Society Fellows Program.[3] Jerlov Award[edit] The Jerlov Award is awarded by the society biennially ""in recognition of the contribution made to the advancement of our knowledge of the nature and consequences of light in the ocean"" and to ""recognize outstanding achievements in ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing research"".[4] It is named after Nils Gunnar Jerlov, an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. Jerlov\'s work on ocean optical and other similar processes helped to create modern ocean optical research. His book Marine Optics, published in 1976, is still widely referenced by other sources and is read by students of ocean optics and ocean color sensing.[4] Recipients have been:[5] 2020 – Edward S.

Gordon 2002 – Raymond C. Smith 2000 – André Morel Walter Munk Medal[edit] The Walter Munk Award was ""awarded in recognition of distinguished research in oceanography related to sound and the sea"".[6] It is named after Walter Munk, the first recipient in 1993. The award is given by the society jointly with the Office of Naval Research and the Office of the Oceanographer of the Navy. Since 2019, it has been reestablished as the Walter Munk Medal to be awarded biennially ""to an individual ocean scientist for extraordinary accomplishments and novel insights in the area of physical oceanography, ocean acoustics, or marine geophysics"".[7] Recipients have been:[8] 2019 – Larry Mayer 2017 – Andone Lavery 2015 – Carl Wunsch 2013 – W.

Farmer 1993 – Walter Munk Oceanography Society Fellows Program[edit] The Fellows Program ""recognizes individuals who have attained eminence in oceanography through their outstanding contributions to the field of oceanography or its applications during a substantial period of years"".[9] Individuals in the Society can be elected as a TOS Fellow with outstanding contributions to the field of oceanography as well as devotion to the field. An individual is usually considered for nomination after he or she has been a member of the society for at least three years.[9] Journal[edit] Main article: Oceanography (journal) Oceanography is published quarterly—every March, June, September, and December.[2] It contains peer-reviewed articles on many aspects of ocean science.

The citation for Dr. Bricaud recognizes her groundbreaking contributions to ocean optics, which cover experimental and theoretical studies on seawater optical properties, fieldwork-based bio-optical relationships, and algorithms for deriving biogeochemical products from satellite ocean color. She is a senior research scientist at the Laboratoire d\'Océanographie de Villefranche (LOV), CNRS - Sorbonne Université, Villefranche-sur-Mer, France, which she joined in 1976. Her 75 papers received the outstanding number of 11,400 citations, and many opened new avenues of research. Annick mentored numerous students, in France and worldwide, and has a long record of contribution to community service. She is among the first female researchers in optical oceanography. Dr. Bricaud will receive the award on October 11, 2018, during a ceremony at the Ocean Optics XXIV Conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The nominating letter for Dr. Bricaud states, ""Annick\'s early career work then provided, and still provides today, a powerful framework for interpreting the natural variability encountered in field observations and for modeling ocean color for satellite applications. Annick\'s coupled theoretical-experimental studies published in 1981 continue to be among the most cited in optical oceanography. Measuring optical properties, in particular backscattering, was not an easy task at a time where no user-friendly, commercially available, instrumentation existed. Hence Annick had to design and build, for her PhD research, her own light back-scatterometer equipped with an integrating sphere, which she could do thanks to her strong engineering background in theoretical and empirical physical optics. She was the ideal person, at the right place, and at a critical time."" ### Nils Gunnar Jerlov was an early leader in the area of ocean optics research. His name is recognized widely within the entire international oceanographic research community. Jerlov\'s theoretical and experimental work on ocean optical and related processes helped form the foundation of modern ocean optical research. He proposed the concept of an optical ocean water mass classification and the Jerlov water types are familiar to many outside of the ocean optics community. His book, Marine Optics, published in 1976, remains widely referenced and is considered required reading for all students of ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing. The Oceanography Society (TOS) commemorates Dr. Jerlov and his many contributions to the study of light in the ocean with an international award, established in his name, to recognize outstanding achievements in ocean optics and ocean color remote sensing research. The Oceanography Society (TOS) was founded in 1988 to advance oceanographic research, technology, and education, and to disseminate knowledge of oceanography and its application through research and education. TOS promotes the broad understanding of oceanography, facilitates consensus building across all the disciplines of the field, and informs the public about ocean research, innovative technology, and educational opportunities throughout the spectrum of oceanographic inquiry. TOS welcomes members from all nations. Any individual, business, or organization interested in ocean sciences is encouraged to join and to participate in the activities and benefits of the society.

ABOUT NILS GUNNAR JERLOV Professor Nils Gunnar Jerlov (1910–1990) graduated in 1939 with a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Lund. He was very active in many fields of scientific research including nuclear physics, environmental pollution, and the ocean heat budget. However, he is best known for his many contributions to ocean optics; the study of how light interacts with ocean water. His work ranged from fundamental theory and predictive models to sensor development to field and laboratory observations. In 1947–48 Dr. Jerlov participated in the Albatross Expedition, a worldwide Swedish oceanographic expedition to study ocean sediments. His observations during this expedition combined with data he collected around the world during many other campaigns, often in collaboration with leading oceanographers of his time, laid the foundations for his optical classification of ocean water; the well-known “Jerlov water types”. He summarized his own work and those of many others in his 1968 book “Optical Oceanography”, which he revised in 1976 and published under the title “Marine Optics”. In 1963 Dr. Jerlov was appointed professor in physical oceanography at the University of Copenhagen, a position he held until 1978 when he retired. While there, he established one of the leading international centers of excellence in optical oceanography. He was a member of numerous international associations such as the International Association for Physical Oceanography, the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, the Nordic Committee on Physical Oceanography, and the Danish National Board for Oceanography. Dr. Jerlov was a man of peace and had no understanding of disputes between colleagues regarding the publication of scientific findings. He was a leading figure in science promoting the establishment of national and international oceanographic cooperation.

In 1999, it was fully incorporated into Harvard College. The college was named for the early Harvard benefactor Anne Mowlson (née Radcliffe) and was one of the Seven Sisters colleges.[1] For the first 70 years of its existence, Radcliffe conferred undergraduate and graduate degrees. Beginning in 1963, it awarded joint Harvard-Radcliffe diplomas to undergraduates. In 1977, Radcliffe signed a formal ""non-merger merger"" agreement with Harvard, and completed a full integration with Harvard in 1999. Within Harvard University, Radcliffe\'s former administrative campus, Radcliffe Yard, is home to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Former Radcliffe housing at the Radcliffe Quadrangle, including Pforzheimer House, Cabot House, and Currier House, has been incorporated into Harvard College\'s house system. Under the terms of the 1999 consolidation, Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle retain the ""Radcliffe"" designation in perpetuity. History[edit] 19th century[edit] Fay House, one of the college\'s first buildings, and the gymnasium in c.\u20091904 The ""Harvard Annex,"" a private program for the instruction of women by Harvard faculty, was founded in 1879 after prolonged efforts by women to gain access to Harvard College. Arthur Gilman, a Cambridge resident, banker, philanthropist and writer, was the founder of what became The Annex/Radcliffe.[2] At a time when higher education for women was a sharply controversial topic, Gilman hoped to establish a higher educational opportunity for his daughter that exceeded what was generally available in female seminaries and the new women\'s colleges such as Vassar and Wellesley. These schools were in their early years and had substantial numbers of faculty who were not university trained. In conversations with the chair of Harvard College\'s classics department, Gilman outlined a plan to have Harvard faculty deliver instruction to a small group of Cambridge and Boston women. He approached Harvard President Charles William Eliot with the idea, and Eliot approved.[3] Gilman and Eliot recruited a group of prominent and well-connected Cambridge women to manage the plan. These women were Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, Mary H. Cooke, Stella Scott Gilman, Mary B. Greenough, Ellen Hooper Gurney, Alice Mary Longfellow, and Lillian Horsford. Building upon Gilman\'s premise, the committee convinced 44 members of the Harvard faculty to consider giving lectures to female students in exchange for extra income paid by the committee. The program came to be known informally as ""The Harvard Annex."" The course of study for the first year included 51 courses in 13 subject areas, an ""impressive curriculum with greater diversity than that of any other women\'s college at its inception. Courses were offered in Greek, Latin, English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish; philosophy, political economy, history, music, mathematics, physics, and natural history.""[4] The first graduation ceremonies took place in the library of Longfellow House on Brattle Street, just above where George Washington\'s generals had slept a century earlier.[5] The committee members hoped that by raising an endowment for The Annex, they could persuade Harvard to admit women directly into Harvard College, but the university resisted.[6] In his 1869 inaugural address as president of Harvard, Charles Eliot summed up the official Harvard position toward female students when he said, ""The world knows next to nothing about the capacities of the female sex. Only after generations of civil freedom and social equality will it be possible to obtain the data necessary for an adequate discussion of woman\'s natural tendencies, tastes, and capabilities...It is not the business of the University to decide this mooted point.""[7] Harvard Examinations for Women[edit] From 1874 to 1881, Harvard administered the Harvard Examinations for Women to increase women\'s educational opportunities, after being pressured by the Women\'s Education Association of Boston. During these seven years, 107 women participated; 36 received certificates.[8] The low number of certificates received by women led Harvard to change the exam in 1881. At the time, women could also be admitted into the ""Harvard Annex"", the women\'s version of a college education. The ""Harvard Examinations for Women"" included subjects such as history; literature of Shakespeare and Chaucer; languages such as Latin, French, and German; botany; and mathematics. These tests were similar to the admittance exam given to men applying to Harvard College. When a woman passed a subject, she would receive a signed certificate from Harvard\'s president acknowledging her passing mark.[8] The Harvard Examinations for Women were ended two years after ""Harvard Annex"" officially became Radcliffe College, the women\'s equivalent to Harvard College. When confronted in 1883 with the notion of females receiving Harvard degrees, the university\'s treasurer stated, ""I have no prejudice in the matter of education of women and am quite willing to see Yale or Columbia take any risks they like, but I feel bound to protect Harvard College from what seems to me a risky experiment.""[9] In 1888, Harvard President Eliot communicated to a faculty member he intended to hire, that ""There is no obligation to teach at The Annex. Those professors who on general grounds take an interest in the education of women...feel some obligation but there are many professors who think it their duty NOT to teach there, in which opinion some of the Corporation and Overseers agree.""[10] Eliot was strongly against co-education, saying, ""The difficulties involved in a common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age are very grave. The necessary police regulations are exceedingly burdensome.""[11] In December 1893, The Boston Globe reported, ""President of Harvard To Sign Parchments of the Fair Graduates"".[12] Students seeking admission to the new women\'s college were required to sit for the same entrance examinations required of Harvard College students. The committee persevered despite Eliot\'s skepticism. The project proved to be a success, attracting a growing number of students. As a result, the Annex was incorporated in 1882 as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, widow of Harvard professor Louis Agassiz, as president.[13] This society awarded certificates to students but did not have the power to confer academic degrees. In subsequent years, ongoing discussions with Harvard about admitting women directly into the university still came to a dead end. Instead, Harvard and the Annex negotiated the creation of a degree-granting institution, with Harvard professors serving as its faculty and visiting body. This modification of the Annex was chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Radcliffe College in 1894. By 1896, the Globe could headline a story: ""Sweet Girls. They Graduate in Shoals at Radcliffe. Commencement Exercises at Sanders Theatre. Galleries Filled with Fair Friends and Students. Handsome Mrs. Agassiz Made Fine Address. Pres Eliot Commends the Work of the New Institution."" The Globe said, ""Eliot stated that the percentage of graduates with distinction is much higher at Radcliffe than at Harvard"" and that although ""[i]t is to yet to be seen whether the women have the originality and pioneering spirit which will fit them to be leaders, perhaps they will when they have had as many generations of thorough education as men.""[14] 20th century[edit] In 1904, a historian Mary Caroline Crawford wrote the following about the genesis of Radcliffe College: ""...it set up housekeeping in two unpretending rooms in the Appian Way, Cambridge....Probably in all the history of colleges in America there could not be found a story so full of color and interest as that of the beginning of this woman\'s college. The bathroom of the little house was pressed into service as a laboratory for physics, students and instructors alike making the best of all inconveniences. Because the institution was housed with a private family, generous mothering was given to the girls when they needed it.""[15] In the first two decades of the 20th century, Radcliffe championed the beginnings of its own campus, consisting of the Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from Harvard University. The original Radcliffe gymnasium and library, and the Bertram, Whitman, Eliot, and Barnard dormitories were constructed during this period. With the 1920s and 1930s, dormitories Briggs Hall (1924) and Cabot Hall (1937) were built on the Quadrangle, and in the Radcliffe Yard, the administrative building Byerly Hall (1932) and the classroom building Longfellow Hall (1930). Mary Almy was the architect.[16] English professor Barrett Wendell warned his colleagues about continued cooperation with Radcliffe, saying that Harvard could ""suddenly find itself committed to coeducation somewhat as unwary men lay themselves open to actions for breach of promise.""[17] In Wendell\'s view, Harvard needed to remain ""purely virile.""[17] In 1923, Ada Comstock, a leader in the movement to provide women with higher education, who hailed from the University of Minnesota and Smith College, became the college\'s third president. She was a key figure in the college\'s early 20th-century development. Speaking of her, one alumna remembers that ""we were in awe of \'Miss Comstock... and knew even then that we had been touched by a vanishing breed of female educator. Ada Comstock had an extraordinary presence—she radiated dignity, strength, and decisiveness.""[18] In the early 1940s, she negotiated a new relationship with Harvard that vastly expanded women\'s access to the full Harvard course catalog. Growth[edit] A radio science class at Radcliffe College in 1922 Byerly Hall, built in 1932 David McCord set the college apart from the other Seven Sister institutions, saying ""there is one respect in which Radcliffe differs from her sisters, and this should be made clear. Although she divides with Barnard, Bryn Mawr, and Wellesley all advantages of a large city, and enjoys the further privilege of being front-fence neighbor to Harvard University, Radcliffe alone has had from the first the strength of a university faculty....Thus, from the beginning, Radcliffe has been a woman\'s Harvard. It is still a separate institution, with its own corporation, receiving from Harvard no financial aid.""[19] Because it had a university – as opposed to ""collegiate"" – faculty, Radcliffe was unique among the Seven Sisters in being able to provide a graduate program with a wide number of opportunities for students to pursue advanced studies. M. Carey Thomas, the second president and chief visionary of Bryn Mawr College, lobbied against the conversion of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women into Radcliffe College precisely because the Cambridge rival\'s access to a university faculty competed with Bryn Mawr\'s own academic ambitions.[20] Between 1890 and 1963, Radcliffe awarded more than 750 PhDs and more than 3000 masters degrees to women. During the 1950s, the school conferred more PhDs to women than any schools other than Columbia and the University of Chicago.[21] In 1955–56, the college produced more female PhDs than any other institution in the United States.[22] Because Radcliffe\'s faculty was Harvard\'s, in the college\'s first 50 years, professors from Harvard, each under individual contracts with the Radcliffe administration – duplicated lectures, providing them first for men in the Harvard Yard and then crossing the Cambridge Common to provide the same lectures to women in the Radcliffe Yard. Professor Elwood Byerly wrote that he ""always found the spirit, industry, and ability of the girls admirable—indeed, the average has been higher in my mathematics classes in the Annex than in my classes at the college.[23] In March 1915, The New York Times reported in 1915 that all of the prizes offered in a playwriting competition at Harvard and Radcliffe that year were won by Radcliffe students. One of the Harvard contributions received honorable mention.[24] In the early 1960s, the newspaper also reported that ""taking the same courses and exams as Harvard, 60 percent of Radcliffe\'s girls [sic] were on the Dean\'s List as compared with 42 percent of Harvard men [sic].""[25] Dorothy Howells noted that, ""Allegations were made that Radcliffe was a ""vampire"" and a ""temptress"" enticing the teacher from his career-advancing research and publication with the lure of additional income.""[26] Ruth Hubbard, a member of the Harvard faculty from 1974 to 1990 and a member of the Radcliffe class of 1944, noted that ""the senior (Harvard) professors were less than thrilled to have to repeat their lectures at Radcliffe. The lower rank faculty members, who were sometimes detailed off to teach the introductory science courses at Radcliffe instead of teaching Harvard students, felt even more declasse.""[27] Marion Cannon Schlesinger, Radcliffe Class of 1934, noted that ""there were, to be sure, certain professors who looked with horror at the incursions of women into the sacred precincts of Harvard College, even at the safe distance of the Radcliffe Yard, and would have nothing to do with the academic arrangements by which their colleagues taught the Radcliffe girls. Professor Roger Merriman, for example, the first master of Eliot House and a professor of history, would not have been caught dead teaching a Radcliffe class."".[28] During World War II, declines in male enrollment at Harvard and heightened sensitivity about the use of resources called for a new, more efficient arrangement concerning faculty time. Under the leadership of President Comstock, Radcliffe and Harvard signed an agreement that for the first time allowed Radcliffe and Harvard students to attend the same classes in the Harvard Yard, officially beginning joint instruction in 1943. Equally significant, the agreement ended the era in which individual faculty members at Harvard could choose whether to enter contracts with Radcliffe. The agreement instead opened the entire Harvard catalogue to Radcliffe students, in exchange for which Radcliffe made a payment to Harvard of a fixed portion of Radcliffe tuitions. President Comstock noted that the agreement was ""the most significant event since our charter was granted in 1894.""[29] All Harvard faculty, whether interested or not, had a legal obligation to teach Radcliffe students. In practice a few holdouts on the Harvard faculty maneuvered around this obligation by announcing that their classes had ""limited enrollment"" and then limiting enrollment solely to male students. At the time, both Harvard and Radcliffe were adamant in telling the press that this arrangement was ""joint instruction"" but not ""coeducation."" Reacting to the agreement, Harvard President James Bryant Conant said, ""Harvard was not coeducational in theory, only in practice.""[30] Indeed, Radcliffe continued to maintain a separate admissions office which, by general acknowledgment, was more stringent in its academic requirements of applicants than Harvard\'s. Most extra-curricular activities at the two colleges remained separate. Following World War II, Radcliffe negotiated a higher ceiling on its student enrollment. This success was orchestrated in tandem with additional housing construction. Moors Hall was completed in 1949, Holmes Hall in 1952, the Cronkhite Graduate Center in 1956, and Comstock Hall in 1958.[31] The added dormitory space and national recruiting campaigns led to an increasingly national and international student body. In 1961, the Jordan Cooperative Houses, an option for students to engage in more communal living, with student responsibility for shopping for food, preparing meals and housekeeping, were built, and the college purchased Wolbach Hall, an apartment building also known as 124 Walker Street, in 1964. Radcliffe constructed Hilles Library in 1966[32] and the Radcliffe Quadrangle Athletic Center in 1982. Also in 1961, then President Mary Bunting reorganized the autonomous Radcliffe dormitories into ""houses,"" mirroring Harvard\'s houses and Yale University\'s residential colleges. The three houses (North, South, and East) were eventually consolidated into two (North and South). In 1970, the college completed construction of Currier House, the first Radcliffe House designed with the ""House Plan"" in mind.[33] South House eventually was renamed Cabot House in 1984 while North House became Pforzheimer House in 1995. Bunting felt that the house system would give Radcliffe students an intellectual community comparable to what Harvard students were getting, bringing together faculty and students in a way the free-standing Radcliffe dormitories did not, and allowing all to see with greater clarity the aspirations, capabilities, and interests of undergraduate women. Speaking generally about her philosophy for Radcliffe, President Bunting noted that ""part of our special purpose is to convey to our students and through them to others that there is no basic conflict between being intellectual and being feminine.""[34] Bunting also established the Radcliffe Institute in 1961. The institute – a precursor to the current Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study – gave financial support, access to research libraries and facilities, and recognition to scholarly women who had taken time away from intellectual pursuits to focus on home and family. In providing women with a venue to return to academia, Bunting was recognizing that traditional academic institutions were premised on a male life trajectory where a scholar\'s domestic concerns were taken care of by someone else (usually a wife). The Radcliffe Institute, later renamed the Bunting Institute, was an institution premised on the needs of a female life trajectory, providing opportunities that might otherwise have been truncated by women\'s decisions during early adulthood to leave academia to raise children. In the 1930s, Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell took a dim view of Radcliffe, maintaining that the time Harvard professors spent providing lectures to women distracted the faculty from their scholarship, and providing Radcliffe women access to research facilities and Harvard museums was – in his view – an unnecessary burden on the university\'s resources. He threatened to scuttle the relationship between the two institutions. Radcliffe was forced to agree to a limitation on the size of its student body, with 750 spaces for undergraduates and 250 for graduate students.[35] A ceiling on enrollment of women when compared to the enrollment of men was renegotiated upward at various points throughout the relationship with Harvard and remained constant in Radcliffe\'s operations until it began its ultimate incorporation into Harvard University in 1977. Presidents of Radcliffe College[edit] The office of the president was created with the incorporation of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in 1882. The society became Radcliffe College in 1894. Name Dates Elizabeth Cary Agassiz 1882–1903 LeBaron Russell Briggs 1903–23 Ada Louise Comstock 1923–43 Wilbur Kitchener Jordan 1943–60 Mary Bunting 1960–72 Matina Souretis Horner 1972–89 Linda S. Wilson 1989–99 Mary Maples Dunn acting president, July–September 1999; acting dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, September 1999–December 2000 Graduate and post-graduate opportunities[edit] Radcliffe staff were invested in assisting women graduates with career planning and placement, as well as providing a number of different programs to provide post-graduate study for women. The Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration was begun as career training for alums interested in business. It grew to become a vehicle for women to pursue study at Harvard\'s Business School. Other post-graduate courses of study at Radcliffe grew as the undergraduate women students became more a part of Harvard University. The Radcliffe Publishing Course offered students experience in editing and other skills needed to enter the field of publishing. The Radcliffe Seminars Program in Landscape Design gave students a chance to study landscape design before it was a course of study at the Harvard Design School, and in a less formal environment. Radcliffe first granted PhDs starting in 1902. Between 1894 and 1902, multiple students completed all course and thesis requirements for a PhD degree in the department of zoology, working in the Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory, without receiving the title.[36] Student life and notable extracurricular activities[edit] Beyond the life of the mind, another appeal of Radcliffe was the comparative freedom that its undergraduates enjoyed compared to students at other women\'s colleges. Cambridge and Boston provided diversions that were denied to women at more geographically isolated institutions. In his history of the college, David McCord noted that ""the music, theaters and museums were surprisingly close.""[37] While students at many women\'s colleges only had social interactions with men on weekends, Radcliffe students saw men in town and, after 1943, in classes and laboratories on a daily basis while still having their own institution, student organizations and activities, and space. In the 1950s, an era of ""in loco parentis"" at many postsecondary institutions, it was common at women\'s colleges for housemothers to keep diligent watch of the time when women returned to their dorms, locking the doors when check-in hour had arrived and punishing women who missed their check-in times. Radcliffe students, by contrast, had their own dormitory keys and filled out sign-in sheets when they arrived in the evening. Their lives were not as cloistered as those of some of their counterparts at the sister schools, and according to an article in Mademoiselle Magazine, ""it was the richness and freedom of life at Radcliffe"" which left its mark on the student body.[38] One graduate of the class of 1934 noted, ""We were getting the best education in the country, and besides, we weren\'t banished to the sticks to rusticate. Weekends at Yale and Princeton may have been the answer to a maiden\'s prayer at Vassar, but we did not have to wait for ceremonial weekends for our entertainment: there were those among the Harvard population who recognized our ""merits.""[39] A student from the early 1960s picked up on this theme, contrasting the Radcliffe experience with that of Smith. ""There are smart girls at Smith, all right,"" she said. ""But they don\'t seem to get much out of them there. Four years later they don\'t seem to be any brighter. And they have this crazy week-end system. You spend all week in Bermuda shorts, with your hair in curlers, worrying over who\'s going to take you to Amherst or New Haven Friday night. It seems to me that sort of thing actually retards you in the long run.""[40] (Conversely, the greater seclusion of places such as Smith, Vassar and Mt. Holyoke sometimes made these latter institutions more attractive to socially conservative families.) Reflecting on her time at Radcliffe, writer Alison Lurie stated that ""most of the time we were in a mild state of euphoria...our lives were luxurious by modern undergraduate standards...We had private rooms, cleaned and tidied by tolerant Irish maids; a laundry called for our dirty clothes every week and returned them carefully washed and ironed; we ate off of china in our own dining room and sat in drawing rooms that resembled those of a good women\'s club.""[41] ""Pluck"" was a quality attributed to some Radcliffe students. Beth Gutcheon of the class of 1967 wrote in a reminiscence that ""One night a classmate of mine was leaving the library alone at eleven when somebody jumped her from behind and knocked her to the ground. She yelled, \'Oh, Christ, I don\'t have time for this. I have an exam tomorrow!\' and after a disappointed pause, her attacker got up and went away.""[42] Throughout most of the college\'s history, residential life and student activities at Radcliffe remained separate from those at Harvard, with separate dormitories and dining facilities (located on the Radcliffe Quadrangle), newspapers (The Radcliffe News, Percussion), radio stations (WRRB and WRAD, a.k.a. Radio Radcliffe), drama society (The Idler), student government (Radcliffe Student Government Association and later, The Radcliffe Union of Students), yearbooks, athletic programs, choral associations (The Radcliffe Choral Society, the Cliffe Clefs, and later the Radcliffe Pitches), etc. (located in the Radcliffe Yard). Radcliffe had greater diversity in housing options than Harvard, with college-owned frame houses, an apartment building, and co-operative housing for students who were not interested in immersion in dormitory life or life within the House System. Dances were popular features of undergraduate life. ""At different times there were class dances, club dances, junior and senior proms, sophomore tea dances, Christmas dances, and spring formals. Dormitory-based dances were known as \'jolly-ups.\'""[43] One particularly popular event during the 1950s was the Radcliffe Grant in Aid show, which was sponsored by the student government. The show raised money for scholarships and always ended with a student kick-line in red shorts. Perhaps because of the shorts, Harvard students were particularly drawn to the event.[43] The Radcliffe Choral Society was a popular and influential student group. Started in 1899 and conducted by Marie Gillison, a German-born singing teacher, the group cultivated an interest in sophisticated classical music at a time when many collegiate choral groups were devoted to college songs and more popular ditties. Archibald Davidson, who took up the reins of conducting the Choral Society after Gillison (he also conducted the Harvard Glee Club), stated, ""I sometimes wonder how much, if anything, Harvard realizes that it owes to Radcliffe... Harvard...should not forget that while its Glee Club was slowly progressing toward enlightenment, Radcliffe, just across the Common, had for a long time under Mrs. Gillison\'s direction set an example of devotion to the best music.""[44] Davidson added that ""without the early and enthusiastic cooperation of \'the young ladies of Radcliffe\' the impressive tradition of college choral singing, which is now nationwide and which is always associated first with Cambridge, would almost certainly have been established much later here or would have originated elsewhere.""[44] Arranged by Mrs. Gillison, the 1917 Choral Society concert with the Harvard Glee Club and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was a footnote in music history, the first time a university chorus sang with a major orchestra. The concert became an annual tradition for many years. The Radcliffe Crew is the oldest women\'s rowing program in the Ivy League. Even after the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe, the team maintains the Radcliffe name and Radcliffe colors as a sign of respect for the tradition of Radcliffe and the women who fought to establish the rowing program. The crew has a distinguished history. The team won the national championship in 1973 and thus got to represent the United States at the Eastern European Championships in Moscow. In 1974, the Eastern Association of Women\'s Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) was formed. In both 1974 and 1975, Radcliffe won consecutive Eastern Sprints titles. In 1987, Radcliffe\'s heavyweight varsity eight completed an undefeated season with a victory at Eastern Sprints and an Ivy championship title. Six of the crew\'s eight rowers went on to compete in the Olympic Games. In 1989, Radcliffe was also undefeated with a Sprints championship and Ivy title. The season finale was a victory in the Open Eight at the Henley Women\'s Regatta in England. Growing consolidation with Harvard[edit] Elizabeth Cary Agassiz House, 2012 The parallel Radcliffe and Harvard student universes—with formal intersections only in the classroom—continued until the 1960s. At this point, awareness of the comparative benefits of Radcliffe vis-a-vis the other Seven Sisters was increasingly eclipsed by growing sensitivity to the disadvantages that Radcliffe students had vis-a-vis Harvard students. Harvard students lived closer to the Harvard Yard, while Radcliffe students had a longer walk to Yard-based classes from the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Harvard housing was more luxurious than Radcliffe dormitories, and much more of the schools\' shared intellectual life took place on the Harvard campus. Financial aid and student prizes at Harvard were larger than those at Radcliffe, even though students from the two schools were enrolled in the same courses. By the late 1950s, the terms of the ""joint instruction"" agreement still imposed a ceiling on the enrollment of Radcliffe students, with Harvard males getting four times the number of spots in a freshman class that Radcliffe students got. And at the end of four years of study, students at Harvard received a diploma from Harvard while Radcliffe students taking the same courses received a diploma from Radcliffe. These asymmetries did not bother all students, as some viewed the differences as a matter of course between two different institutions. This perspective was particularly strong with Radcliffe students who graduated before the turbulent 1960s. One alumna from the 1940s mused that at Radcliffe ""we were supremely happy in our own environment. For us, Harvard remained \'the other.\' Most of us felt no connection to it;...instead, we enjoyed our own collegiate activities and traditions.[18] Another graduate from the class of 1949 noted that she was ""having my cake and eating it, too. In addition to my Harvard education, I was enjoying the benefits of a small women\'s college. The Radcliffe Quadrangle was quiet and peaceful, life in the dormitories was friendly and gracious. ... The women who had chosen to come to Radcliffe all were intelligent, quite independent, and concerned with the world around them.""[45] Additionally, Radcliffe offered a cultural advantage over Harvard: even when enrolled in the same courses, Harvard and Radcliffe student took exams separately, as Radcliffe College\'s honor code necessitated a vastly different exam-taking environment: ""Where the men\'s exam rituals included proctors, dress codes, and a strict requirement of silence, the Radcliffe women took un-proctored exams, relished the chance to wear informal pants instead of skirts, and could enter and exit the building as they wished so long as they did not cheat.""[46] Similarly, the Radcliffe honor code provided for more generous library and campus space privileges (for student groups) than the more bureaucratic Harvard systems allowed. However, some people within the Radcliffe community were less sanguine about the differences between the two schools, seeing the relationship with Harvard as an institutionalized separate but unequal experience for women. Writer Alison Lurie reflected that ""for Radcliffe students of my time the salient fact about Harvard was that it so evidently was not ours. Our position was like that of poor relations living just outside the walls of a great estate: patronized by some of our grand relatives, tolerated by others, and snubbed or avoided by the rest.""[47] Famed poet Adrienne Rich, class of 1951, described receiving an ""insidious double message"" when she was at Radcliffe. Radcliffe students ""were told that we were the most privileged college women in America,"" but ""while intellectual and emotional life went on with intensity in all-female dorms, and we had our own newspaper, our own literary magazine, clubs, and student government, we knew that the real power (and money) were invested in Harvard\'s institutions, from which we were excluded.""[48] Acceptance of the 19th-century rationales for this exclusion was fading, particularly as during the 1960s, a nationwide movement for co-education grew. Reflecting this movement, many Radcliffe students began to insist upon receiving Harvard diplomas for their academic work and upon merging Radcliffe and Harvard extra-curricular activities. Growing budgetary problems at Radcliffe encouraged this insistence. The Radcliffe Graduate School merged with Harvard\'s in 1963, and from that year onward Radcliffe undergraduates received Harvard University diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard. (Harvard students\' diplomas were signed only by the president of Harvard.) Radcliffe students were fully and permanently admitted to Harvard\'s Lamont Library in 1967.[49][50] Many Radcliffe and Harvard student groups combined during the 1960s and joint commencement exercises between the two institutions began in 1970. In 1971, largely in response to gains made by newly co-ed Princeton and Yale in their respective yields of students admitted to Harvard, Yale and Princeton,[51] and to comparable admissions competition posed by the increasing national popularity of co-ed Stanford,[52] Harvard president Derek Bok reduced the admissions ratio of Harvard students to Radcliffe students from 4:1 to 5:2.[51] That same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students through an experimental program, and in 1972 full co-residence between the two colleges was instituted. The schools\' departments of athletics merged shortly thereafter. By the late 1960s there were open discussions between Radcliffe and Harvard about complete merger of the two institutions—which in truth meant abolition of Radcliffe. However, a merger study committee of the Radcliffe Alumnae Association recommended caution. In a prepared statement, the committee reported that ""it would be a mistake to dissolve Radcliffe at this time. Women\'s self-awareness is increasing as the \'women\'s liberation movement develops and as moderate groups call attention to the life styles and problems particular to women. This is precisely the wrong time to abolish a prestigious women\'s college which should be giving leadership to women as they seek to define and enlarge their role in society.""[53] Instead of a complete merger, in 1977 Radcliffe president Matina Horner and Harvard president Derek Bok signed an agreement that, through their admission to Radcliffe, put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. The so-called ""non-merger merger"" combined the Radcliffe and Harvard admissions offices and ended the forced ceiling on female enrollment. In practice most of the energies of Radcliffe (which remained an autonomous institution) were then devoted to the institution\'s research initiatives and fellowships, rather than to female undergraduates. The Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduate communities and classes came to be known officially as ""Harvard and Radcliffe"" or ""Harvard-Radcliffe"", and female students continued to be awarded degrees signed by both presidents. Radcliffe continued to own its campus and provided financial aid, undergraduate prizes, and externship and fellowship opportunities to Radcliffe students, and the college continued to sponsor academic access programs for high school girls and continuing education opportunities for people outside the traditional college age. The college also continued to support programs and workshops targeting female undergraduates. In practice, though, Radcliffe at this point had minimal impact on the average undergraduate\'s day to day experiences at the university. This minimal role fueled still more talk about a full merger of the two schools. Conversely, supporters of the ""non-merger merger"" maintained that the agreement gave Radcliffe students the full benefits of Harvard citizenship while allowing maintenance of the proud Radcliffe identity, an institution with its own mission, programs, financial resources and alumnae network. On October 1, 1999, Radcliffe College was fully absorbed into Harvard University; female undergraduates were henceforward members only of Harvard College while Radcliffe College evolved into the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.[54] Radcliffe after the merger[edit] The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, now a division of Harvard University, carries on many of the research and professional development programs that Radcliffe College pioneered and has introduced other programs to the worldwide community of scholars. The end of Radcliffe\'s role as an undergraduate institution, however, still has its detractors. ""Although I realize the merger was inevitable,"" a member of the class of 1959 commented, ""...I nevertheless regret the loss of my college, which gave me so much.[55] Another noted that she ""feels sad that Radcliffe College no longer exists. It, far more than Harvard, defined my college experience. I can\'t remember a single Harvard classmate, but two of my best friends are fellow Cliffies and I exchange correspondence with about a dozen more.""[56] Indeed, many Radcliffe alumnae feel their institution has relinquished its distinguished identity in favor of a male-oriented one that remains steadfastly dismissive of women\'s concerns. This latter perspective gained some traction when, in a voice reminiscent of Presidents Eliot and Lowell, Harvard\'s early 21st-century president Lawrence Summers publicly stated that women were not as capable in the sciences as men. Additionally, shortly after full merger of the two schools, Harvard undergraduate women feeling a void in Harvard\'s support for women\'s intellectual and personal development started to lobby Harvard to create a women\'s center. Perhaps not surprisingly, memories of Harvard\'s historical indifference to women have led many Radcliffe alumnae to maintain primary ties to Radcliffe College and not to Harvard University. ""Womenless history has been a Harvard specialty,"" Laurel Thatcher Ulrich noted.[57] The Annex gained some vindication against Presidents Eliot, Lowell, and Summers when Drew Gilpin Faust, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute, replaced Summers and became Harvard\'s first female president. Radcliffe College alumnae continue to press Harvard on the question of the university\'s commitment to women, and increasing the number of female faculty members at Harvard is a particular alumnae interest. Former Radcliffe president Matina Horner once told the New York Times of her surprise when she first delivered a lecture at Harvard in 1969 and four male students approached her. One of these students told her that they ""just wanted to see what it felt like to be lectured by a woman and if a woman could be articulate.""[58] Picking up on the perceived common Harvard blind-eye to women\'s intellectual competence and reflecting on the fact that while at Radcliffe they had had very few female faculty members, in the late 1990s a group of Radcliffe alumnae established the Committee for The Equality of Women at Harvard. The group chose to boycott Harvard\'s fundraising campaigns and sent letters to all 27,000 Radcliffe alumnae and to 13,000 Harvard alumni asking them to shift their donations to an escrow account until the university stepped up its efforts to add women to its tenured faculty. The group has not established quotas that it wants Harvard to meet. Rather, it has stated that individual Harvard departments should measure their percentage of tenured women faculty against a ""realistically available pool"" and create a plan to increase the number of women if that percentage falls short. The group also said that when departments do so, the escrow account (now called the Harvard Women\'s Faculty Fund) will be turned over to Harvard.[59] In the meantime, enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars that Harvard conferred unto Radcliffe at the time of the full merger, the Radcliffe Institute today awards dozens of annual fellowships to prominent academics. Although it does not focus solely on women returning to academe, it is a major research center within Harvard University. Its Schlesinger Library is one of America\'s largest repositories of manuscripts and archives relating to the history of women. Several undergraduate student organizations in Harvard College still refer to Radcliffe in their names, (for example the Radcliffe Union of Students, Harvard\'s feminist organization; the Radcliffe Choral Society, Harvard\'s female choir (now one of the Holden Choirs), which has alumnae from both Radcliffe and Harvard and maintains a repertoire of Radcliffiana; the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra; the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players; the Radcliffe Pitches, a female a cappella singing group; and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club). Two athletic teams still compete under the Radcliffe name: varsity crew, which still rows with Radcliffe\'s black-and-white oarblades and uniforms instead of Harvard\'s crimson-and-white (in 1973 the team had been the only varsity team which voted not to adopt the Harvard name); and club rugby union. In addition, the Harvard University Band still plays a Radcliffe fight song.

In 1999, it was fully incorporated into Harvard College. The college was named for the early Harvard benefactor Anne Mowlson (née Radcliffe) and was one of the Seven Sisters colleges.[1] For the first 70 years of its existence, Radcliffe conferred undergraduate and graduate degrees. Beginning in 1963, it awarded joint Harvard-Radcliffe diplomas to undergraduates. In 1977, Radcliffe signed a formal ""non-merger merger"" agreement with Harvard, and completed a full integration with Harvard in 1999. Within Harvard University, Radcliffe\'s former administrative campus, Radcliffe Yard, is home to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Former Radcliffe housing at the Radcliffe Quadrangle, including Pforzheimer House, Cabot House, and Currier House, has been incorporated into Harvard College\'s house system. Under the terms of the 1999 consolidation, Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle retain the ""Radcliffe"" designation in perpetuity. History[edit] 19th century[edit] Fay House, one of the college\'s first buildings, and the gymnasium in c.\u20091904 The ""Harvard Annex,"" a private program for the instruction of women by Harvard faculty, was founded in 1879 after prolonged efforts by women to gain access to Harvard College. Arthur Gilman, a Cambridge resident, banker, philanthropist and writer, was the founder of what became The Annex/Radcliffe.[2] At a time when higher education for women was a sharply controversial topic, Gilman hoped to establish a higher educational opportunity for his daughter that exceeded what was generally available in female seminaries and the new women\'s colleges such as Vassar and Wellesley. These schools were in their early years and had substantial numbers of faculty who were not university trained. In conversations with the chair of Harvard College\'s classics department, Gilman outlined a plan to have Harvard faculty deliver instruction to a small group of Cambridge and Boston women. He approached Harvard President Charles William Eliot with the idea, and Eliot approved.[3] Gilman and Eliot recruited a group of prominent and well-connected Cambridge women to manage the plan. These women were Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, Mary H. Cooke, Stella Scott Gilman, Mary B. Greenough, Ellen Hooper Gurney, Alice Mary Longfellow, and Lillian Horsford. Building upon Gilman\'s premise, the committee convinced 44 members of the Harvard faculty to consider giving lectures to female students in exchange for extra income paid by the committee. The program came to be known informally as ""The Harvard Annex."" The course of study for the first year included 51 courses in 13 subject areas, an ""impressive curriculum with greater diversity than that of any other women\'s college at its inception. Courses were offered in Greek, Latin, English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish; philosophy, political economy, history, music, mathematics, physics, and natural history.""[4] The first graduation ceremonies took place in the library of Longfellow House on Brattle Street, just above where George Washington\'s generals had slept a century earlier.[5] The committee members hoped that by raising an endowment for The Annex, they could persuade Harvard to admit women directly into Harvard College, but the university resisted.[6] In his 1869 inaugural address as president of Harvard, Charles Eliot summed up the official Harvard position toward female students when he said, ""The world knows next to nothing about the capacities of the female sex. Only after generations of civil freedom and social equality will it be possible to obtain the data necessary for an adequate discussion of woman\'s natural tendencies, tastes, and capabilities...It is not the business of the University to decide this mooted point.""[7] Harvard Examinations for Women[edit] From 1874 to 1881, Harvard administered the Harvard Examinations for Women to increase women\'s educational opportunities, after being pressured by the Women\'s Education Association of Boston. During these seven years, 107 women participated; 36 received certificates.[8] The low number of certificates received by women led Harvard to change the exam in 1881. At the time, women could also be admitted into the ""Harvard Annex"", the women\'s version of a college education. The ""Harvard Examinations for Women"" included subjects such as history; literature of Shakespeare and Chaucer; languages such as Latin, French, and German; botany; and mathematics. These tests were similar to the admittance exam given to men applying to Harvard College. When a woman passed a subject, she would receive a signed certificate from Harvard\'s president acknowledging her passing mark.[8] The Harvard Examinations for Women were ended two years after ""Harvard Annex"" officially became Radcliffe College, the women\'s equivalent to Harvard College. When confronted in 1883 with the notion of females receiving Harvard degrees, the university\'s treasurer stated, ""I have no prejudice in the matter of education of women and am quite willing to see Yale or Columbia take any risks they like, but I feel bound to protect Harvard College from what seems to me a risky experiment.""[9] In 1888, Harvard President Eliot communicated to a faculty member he intended to hire, that ""There is no obligation to teach at The Annex. Those professors who on general grounds take an interest in the education of women...feel some obligation but there are many professors who think it their duty NOT to teach there, in which opinion some of the Corporation and Overseers agree.""[10] Eliot was strongly against co-education, saying, ""The difficulties involved in a common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age are very grave. The necessary police regulations are exceedingly burdensome.""[11] In December 1893, The Boston Globe reported, ""President of Harvard To Sign Parchments of the Fair Graduates"".[12] Students seeking admission to the new women\'s college were required to sit for the same entrance examinations required of Harvard College students. The committee persevered despite Eliot\'s skepticism. The project proved to be a success, attracting a growing number of students. As a result, the Annex was incorporated in 1882 as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, widow of Harvard professor Louis Agassiz, as president.[13] This society awarded certificates to students but did not have the power to confer academic degrees. In subsequent years, ongoing discussions with Harvard about admitting women directly into the university still came to a dead end. Instead, Harvard and the Annex negotiated the creation of a degree-granting institution, with Harvard professors serving as its faculty and visiting body. This modification of the Annex was chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Radcliffe College in 1894. By 1896, the Globe could headline a story: ""Sweet Girls. They Graduate in Shoals at Radcliffe. Commencement Exercises at Sanders Theatre. Galleries Filled with Fair Friends and Students. Handsome Mrs. Agassiz Made Fine Address. Pres Eliot Commends the Work of the New Institution."" The Globe said, ""Eliot stated that the percentage of graduates with distinction is much higher at Radcliffe than at Harvard"" and that although ""[i]t is to yet to be seen whether the women have the originality and pioneering spirit which will fit them to be leaders, perhaps they will when they have had as many generations of thorough education as men.""[14] 20th century[edit] In 1904, a historian Mary Caroline Crawford wrote the following about the genesis of Radcliffe College: ""...it set up housekeeping in two unpretending rooms in the Appian Way, Cambridge....Probably in all the history of colleges in America there could not be found a story so full of color and interest as that of the beginning of this woman\'s college. The bathroom of the little house was pressed into service as a laboratory for physics, students and instructors alike making the best of all inconveniences. Because the institution was housed with a private family, generous mothering was given to the girls when they needed it.""[15] In the first two decades of the 20th century, Radcliffe championed the beginnings of its own campus, consisting of the Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from Harvard University. The original Radcliffe gymnasium and library, and the Bertram, Whitman, Eliot, and Barnard dormitories were constructed during this period. With the 1920s and 1930s, dormitories Briggs Hall (1924) and Cabot Hall (1937) were built on the Quadrangle, and in the Radcliffe Yard, the administrative building Byerly Hall (1932) and the classroom building Longfellow Hall (1930). Mary Almy was the architect.[16] English professor Barrett Wendell warned his colleagues about continued cooperation with Radcliffe, saying that Harvard could ""suddenly find itself committed to coeducation somewhat as unwary men lay themselves open to actions for breach of promise.""[17] In Wendell\'s view, Harvard needed to remain ""purely virile.""[17] In 1923, Ada Comstock, a leader in the movement to provide women with higher education, who hailed from the University of Minnesota and Smith College, became the college\'s third president. She was a key figure in the college\'s early 20th-century development. Speaking of her, one alumna remembers that ""we were in awe of \'Miss Comstock... and knew even then that we had been touched by a vanishing breed of female educator. Ada Comstock had an extraordinary presence—she radiated dignity, strength, and decisiveness.""[18] In the early 1940s, she negotiated a new relationship with Harvard that vastly expanded women\'s access to the full Harvard course catalog. Growth[edit] A radio science class at Radcliffe College in 1922 Byerly Hall, built in 1932 David McCord set the college apart from the other Seven Sister institutions, saying ""there is one respect in which Radcliffe differs from her sisters, and this should be made clear. Although she divides with Barnard, Bryn Mawr, and Wellesley all advantages of a large city, and enjoys the further privilege of being front-fence neighbor to Harvard University, Radcliffe alone has had from the first the strength of a university faculty....Thus, from the beginning, Radcliffe has been a woman\'s Harvard. It is still a separate institution, with its own corporation, receiving from Harvard no financial aid.""[19] Because it had a university – as opposed to ""collegiate"" – faculty, Radcliffe was unique among the Seven Sisters in being able to provide a graduate program with a wide number of opportunities for students to pursue advanced studies. M. Carey Thomas, the second president and chief visionary of Bryn Mawr College, lobbied against the conversion of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women into Radcliffe College precisely because the Cambridge rival\'s access to a university faculty competed with Bryn Mawr\'s own academic ambitions.[20] Between 1890 and 1963, Radcliffe awarded more than 750 PhDs and more than 3000 masters degrees to women. During the 1950s, the school conferred more PhDs to women than any schools other than Columbia and the University of Chicago.[21] In 1955–56, the college produced more female PhDs than any other institution in the United States.[22] Because Radcliffe\'s faculty was Harvard\'s, in the college\'s first 50 years, professors from Harvard, each under individual contracts with the Radcliffe administration – duplicated lectures, providing them first for men in the Harvard Yard and then crossing the Cambridge Common to provide the same lectures to women in the Radcliffe Yard. Professor Elwood Byerly wrote that he ""always found the spirit, industry, and ability of the girls admirable—indeed, the average has been higher in my mathematics classes in the Annex than in my classes at the college.[23] In March 1915, The New York Times reported in 1915 that all of the prizes offered in a playwriting competition at Harvard and Radcliffe that year were won by Radcliffe students. One of the Harvard contributions received honorable mention.[24] In the early 1960s, the newspaper also reported that ""taking the same courses and exams as Harvard, 60 percent of Radcliffe\'s girls [sic] were on the Dean\'s List as compared with 42 percent of Harvard men [sic].""[25] Dorothy Howells noted that, ""Allegations were made that Radcliffe was a ""vampire"" and a ""temptress"" enticing the teacher from his career-advancing research and publication with the lure of additional income.""[26] Ruth Hubbard, a member of the Harvard faculty from 1974 to 1990 and a member of the Radcliffe class of 1944, noted that ""the senior (Harvard) professors were less than thrilled to have to repeat their lectures at Radcliffe. The lower rank faculty members, who were sometimes detailed off to teach the introductory science courses at Radcliffe instead of teaching Harvard students, felt even more declasse.""[27] Marion Cannon Schlesinger, Radcliffe Class of 1934, noted that ""there were, to be sure, certain professors who looked with horror at the incursions of women into the sacred precincts of Harvard College, even at the safe distance of the Radcliffe Yard, and would have nothing to do with the academic arrangements by which their colleagues taught the Radcliffe girls. Professor Roger Merriman, for example, the first master of Eliot House and a professor of history, would not have been caught dead teaching a Radcliffe class."".[28] During World War II, declines in male enrollment at Harvard and heightened sensitivity about the use of resources called for a new, more efficient arrangement concerning faculty time. Under the leadership of President Comstock, Radcliffe and Harvard signed an agreement that for the first time allowed Radcliffe and Harvard students to attend the same classes in the Harvard Yard, officially beginning joint instruction in 1943. Equally significant, the agreement ended the era in which individual faculty members at Harvard could choose whether to enter contracts with Radcliffe. The agreement instead opened the entire Harvard catalogue to Radcliffe students, in exchange for which Radcliffe made a payment to Harvard of a fixed portion of Radcliffe tuitions. President Comstock noted that the agreement was ""the most significant event since our charter was granted in 1894.""[29] All Harvard faculty, whether interested or not, had a legal obligation to teach Radcliffe students. In practice a few holdouts on the Harvard faculty maneuvered around this obligation by announcing that their classes had ""limited enrollment"" and then limiting enrollment solely to male students. At the time, both Harvard and Radcliffe were adamant in telling the press that this arrangement was ""joint instruction"" but not ""coeducation."" Reacting to the agreement, Harvard President James Bryant Conant said, ""Harvard was not coeducational in theory, only in practice.""[30] Indeed, Radcliffe continued to maintain a separate admissions office which, by general acknowledgment, was more stringent in its academic requirements of applicants than Harvard\'s. Most extra-curricular activities at the two colleges remained separate. Following World War II, Radcliffe negotiated a higher ceiling on its student enrollment. This success was orchestrated in tandem with additional housing construction. Moors Hall was completed in 1949, Holmes Hall in 1952, the Cronkhite Graduate Center in 1956, and Comstock Hall in 1958.[31] The added dormitory space and national recruiting campaigns led to an increasingly national and international student body. In 1961, the Jordan Cooperative Houses, an option for students to engage in more communal living, with student responsibility for shopping for food, preparing meals and housekeeping, were built, and the college purchased Wolbach Hall, an apartment building also known as 124 Walker Street, in 1964. Radcliffe constructed Hilles Library in 1966[32] and the Radcliffe Quadrangle Athletic Center in 1982. Also in 1961, then President Mary Bunting reorganized the autonomous Radcliffe dormitories into ""houses,"" mirroring Harvard\'s houses and Yale University\'s residential colleges. The three houses (North, South, and East) were eventually consolidated into two (North and South). In 1970, the college completed construction of Currier House, the first Radcliffe House designed with the ""House Plan"" in mind.[33] South House eventually was renamed Cabot House in 1984 while North House became Pforzheimer House in 1995. Bunting felt that the house system would give Radcliffe students an intellectual community comparable to what Harvard students were getting, bringing together faculty and students in a way the free-standing Radcliffe dormitories did not, and allowing all to see with greater clarity the aspirations, capabilities, and interests of undergraduate women. Speaking generally about her philosophy for Radcliffe, President Bunting noted that ""part of our special purpose is to convey to our students and through them to others that there is no basic conflict between being intellectual and being feminine.""[34] Bunting also established the Radcliffe Institute in 1961. The institute – a precursor to the current Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study – gave financial support, access to research libraries and facilities, and recognition to scholarly women who had taken time away from intellectual pursuits to focus on home and family. In providing women with a venue to return to academia, Bunting was recognizing that traditional academic institutions were premised on a male life trajectory where a scholar\'s domestic concerns were taken care of by someone else (usually a wife). The Radcliffe Institute, later renamed the Bunting Institute, was an institution premised on the needs of a female life trajectory, providing opportunities that might otherwise have been truncated by women\'s decisions during early adulthood to leave academia to raise children. In the 1930s, Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell took a dim view of Radcliffe, maintaining that the time Harvard professors spent providing lectures to women distracted the faculty from their scholarship, and providing Radcliffe women access to research facilities and Harvard museums was – in his view – an unnecessary burden on the university\'s resources. He threatened to scuttle the relationship between the two institutions. Radcliffe was forced to agree to a limitation on the size of its student body, with 750 spaces for undergraduates and 250 for graduate students.[35] A ceiling on enrollment of women when compared to the enrollment of men was renegotiated upward at various points throughout the relationship with Harvard and remained constant in Radcliffe\'s operations until it began its ultimate incorporation into Harvard University in 1977. Presidents of Radcliffe College[edit] The office of the president was created with the incorporation of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in 1882. The society became Radcliffe College in 1894.

Wilson 1989–99 Mary Maples Dunn acting president, July–September 1999; acting dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, September 1999–December 2000 Graduate and post-graduate opportunities[edit] Radcliffe staff were invested in assisting women graduates with career planning and placement, as well as providing a number of different programs to provide post-graduate study for women. The Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration was begun as career training for alums interested in business. It grew to become a vehicle for women to pursue study at Harvard\'s Business School. Other post-graduate courses of study at Radcliffe grew as the undergraduate women students became more a part of Harvard University. The Radcliffe Publishing Course offered students experience in editing and other skills needed to enter the field of publishing. The Radcliffe Seminars Program in Landscape Design gave students a chance to study landscape design before it was a course of study at the Harvard Design School, and in a less formal environment. Radcliffe first granted PhDs starting in 1902. Between 1894 and 1902, multiple students completed all course and thesis requirements for a PhD degree in the department of zoology, working in the Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory, without receiving the title.[36] Student life and notable extracurricular activities[edit] Beyond the life of the mind, another appeal of Radcliffe was the comparative freedom that its undergraduates enjoyed compared to students at other women\'s colleges. Cambridge and Boston provided diversions that were denied to women at more geographically isolated institutions. In his history of the college, David McCord noted that ""the music, theaters and museums were surprisingly close.""[37] While students at many women\'s colleges only had social interactions with men on weekends, Radcliffe students saw men in town and, after 1943, in classes and laboratories on a daily basis while still having their own institution, student organizations and activities, and space. In the 1950s, an era of ""in loco parentis"" at many postsecondary institutions, it was common at women\'s colleges for housemothers to keep diligent watch of the time when women returned to their dorms, locking the doors when check-in hour had arrived and punishing women who missed their check-in times. Radcliffe students, by contrast, had their own dormitory keys and filled out sign-in sheets when they arrived in the evening. Their lives were not as cloistered as those of some of their counterparts at the sister schools, and according to an article in Mademoiselle Magazine, ""it was the richness and freedom of life at Radcliffe"" which left its mark on the student body.[38] One graduate of the class of 1934 noted, ""We were getting the best education in the country, and besides, we weren\'t banished to the sticks to rusticate. Weekends at Yale and Princeton may have been the answer to a maiden\'s prayer at Vassar, but we did not have to wait for ceremonial weekends for our entertainment: there were those among the Harvard population who recognized our ""merits.""[39] A student from the early 1960s picked up on this theme, contrasting the Radcliffe experience with that of Smith. ""There are smart girls at Smith, all right,"" she said. ""But they don\'t seem to get much out of them there. Four years later they don\'t seem to be any brighter. And they have this crazy week-end system. You spend all week in Bermuda shorts, with your hair in curlers, worrying over who\'s going to take you to Amherst or New Haven Friday night. It seems to me that sort of thing actually retards you in the long run.""[40] (Conversely, the greater seclusion of places such as Smith, Vassar and Mt. Holyoke sometimes made these latter institutions more attractive to socially conservative families.) Reflecting on her time at Radcliffe, writer Alison Lurie stated that ""most of the time we were in a mild state of euphoria...our lives were luxurious by modern undergraduate standards...We had private rooms, cleaned and tidied by tolerant Irish maids; a laundry called for our dirty clothes every week and returned them carefully washed and ironed; we ate off of china in our own dining room and sat in drawing rooms that resembled those of a good women\'s club.""[41] ""Pluck"" was a quality attributed to some Radcliffe students. Beth Gutcheon of the class of 1967 wrote in a reminiscence that ""One night a classmate of mine was leaving the library alone at eleven when somebody jumped her from behind and knocked her to the ground. She yelled, \'Oh, Christ, I don\'t have time for this. I have an exam tomorrow!\' and after a disappointed pause, her attacker got up and went away.""[42] Throughout most of the college\'s history, residential life and student activities at Radcliffe remained separate from those at Harvard, with separate dormitories and dining facilities (located on the Radcliffe Quadrangle), newspapers (The Radcliffe News, Percussion), radio stations (WRRB and WRAD, a.k.a. Radio Radcliffe), drama society (The Idler), student government (Radcliffe Student Government Association and later, The Radcliffe Union of Students), yearbooks, athletic programs, choral associations (The Radcliffe Choral Society, the Cliffe Clefs, and later the Radcliffe Pitches), etc. (located in the Radcliffe Yard). Radcliffe had greater diversity in housing options than Harvard, with college-owned frame houses, an apartment building, and co-operative housing for students who were not interested in immersion in dormitory life or life within the House System. Dances were popular features of undergraduate life. ""At different times there were class dances, club dances, junior and senior proms, sophomore tea dances, Christmas dances, and spring formals. Dormitory-based dances were known as \'jolly-ups.\'""[43] One particularly popular event during the 1950s was the Radcliffe Grant in Aid show, which was sponsored by the student government. The show raised money for scholarships and always ended with a student kick-line in red shorts. Perhaps because of the shorts, Harvard students were particularly drawn to the event.[43] The Radcliffe Choral Society was a popular and influential student group. Started in 1899 and conducted by Marie Gillison, a German-born singing teacher, the group cultivated an interest in sophisticated classical music at a time when many collegiate choral groups were devoted to college songs and more popular ditties. Archibald Davidson, who took up the reins of conducting the Choral Society after Gillison (he also conducted the Harvard Glee Club), stated, ""I sometimes wonder how much, if anything, Harvard realizes that it owes to Radcliffe... Harvard...should not forget that while its Glee Club was slowly progressing toward enlightenment, Radcliffe, just across the Common, had for a long time under Mrs. Gillison\'s direction set an example of devotion to the best music.""[44] Davidson added that ""without the early and enthusiastic cooperation of \'the young ladies of Radcliffe\' the impressive tradition of college choral singing, which is now nationwide and which is always associated first with Cambridge, would almost certainly have been established much later here or would have originated elsewhere.""[44] Arranged by Mrs. Gillison, the 1917 Choral Society concert with the Harvard Glee Club and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was a footnote in music history, the first time a university chorus sang with a major orchestra. The concert became an annual tradition for many years. The Radcliffe Crew is the oldest women\'s rowing program in the Ivy League. Even after the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe, the team maintains the Radcliffe name and Radcliffe colors as a sign of respect for the tradition of Radcliffe and the women who fought to establish the rowing program. The crew has a distinguished history. The team won the national championship in 1973 and thus got to represent the United States at the Eastern European Championships in Moscow. In 1974, the Eastern Association of Women\'s Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) was formed. In both 1974 and 1975, Radcliffe won consecutive Eastern Sprints titles. In 1987, Radcliffe\'s heavyweight varsity eight completed an undefeated season with a victory at Eastern Sprints and an Ivy championship title. Six of the crew\'s eight rowers went on to compete in the Olympic Games. In 1989, Radcliffe was also undefeated with a Sprints championship and Ivy title. The season finale was a victory in the Open Eight at the Henley Women\'s Regatta in England. Growing consolidation with Harvard[edit] Elizabeth Cary Agassiz House, 2012 The parallel Radcliffe and Harvard student universes—with formal intersections only in the classroom—continued until the 1960s. At this point, awareness of the comparative benefits of Radcliffe vis-a-vis the other Seven Sisters was increasingly eclipsed by growing sensitivity to the disadvantages that Radcliffe students had vis-a-vis Harvard students. Harvard students lived closer to the Harvard Yard, while Radcliffe students had a longer walk to Yard-based classes from the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Harvard housing was more luxurious than Radcliffe dormitories, and much more of the schools\' shared intellectual life took place on the Harvard campus. Financial aid and student prizes at Harvard were larger than those at Radcliffe, even though students from the two schools were enrolled in the same courses. By the late 1950s, the terms of the ""joint instruction"" agreement still imposed a ceiling on the enrollment of Radcliffe students, with Harvard males getting four times the number of spots in a freshman class that Radcliffe students got. And at the end of four years of study, students at Harvard received a diploma from Harvard while Radcliffe students taking the same courses received a diploma from Radcliffe. These asymmetries did not bother all students, as some viewed the differences as a matter of course between two different institutions. This perspective was particularly strong with Radcliffe students who graduated before the turbulent 1960s. One alumna from the 1940s mused that at Radcliffe ""we were supremely happy in our own environment. For us, Harvard remained \'the other.\' Most of us felt no connection to it;...instead, we enjoyed our own collegiate activities and traditions.[18] Another graduate from the class of 1949 noted that she was ""having my cake and eating it, too. In addition to my Harvard education, I was enjoying the benefits of a small women\'s college. The Radcliffe Quadrangle was quiet and peaceful, life in the dormitories was friendly and gracious. ... The women who had chosen to come to Radcliffe all were intelligent, quite independent, and concerned with the world around them.""[45] Additionally, Radcliffe offered a cultural advantage over Harvard: even when enrolled in the same courses, Harvard and Radcliffe student took exams separately, as Radcliffe College\'s honor code necessitated a vastly different exam-taking environment: ""Where the men\'s exam rituals included proctors, dress codes, and a strict requirement of silence, the Radcliffe women took un-proctored exams, relished the chance to wear informal pants instead of skirts, and could enter and exit the building as they wished so long as they did not cheat.""[46] Similarly, the Radcliffe honor code provided for more generous library and campus space privileges (for student groups) than the more bureaucratic Harvard systems allowed. However, some people within the Radcliffe community were less sanguine about the differences between the two schools, seeing the relationship with Harvard as an institutionalized separate but unequal experience for women. Writer Alison Lurie reflected that ""for Radcliffe students of my time the salient fact about Harvard was that it so evidently was not ours. Our position was like that of poor relations living just outside the walls of a great estate: patronized by some of our grand relatives, tolerated by others, and snubbed or avoided by the rest.""[47] Famed poet Adrienne Rich, class of 1951, described receiving an ""insidious double message"" when she was at Radcliffe. Radcliffe students ""were told that we were the most privileged college women in America,"" but ""while intellectual and emotional life went on with intensity in all-female dorms, and we had our own newspaper, our own literary magazine, clubs, and student government, we knew that the real power (and money) were invested in Harvard\'s institutions, from which we were excluded.""[48] Acceptance of the 19th-century rationales for this exclusion was fading, particularly as during the 1960s, a nationwide movement for co-education grew. Reflecting this movement, many Radcliffe students began to insist upon receiving Harvard diplomas for their academic work and upon merging Radcliffe and Harvard extra-curricular activities. Growing budgetary problems at Radcliffe encouraged this insistence. The Radcliffe Graduate School merged with Harvard\'s in 1963, and from that year onward Radcliffe undergraduates received Harvard University diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard. (Harvard students\' diplomas were signed only by the president of Harvard.) Radcliffe students were fully and permanently admitted to Harvard\'s Lamont Library in 1967.[49][50] Many Radcliffe and Harvard student groups combined during the 1960s and joint commencement exercises between the two institutions began in 1970. In 1971, largely in response to gains made by newly co-ed Princeton and Yale in their respective yields of students admitted to Harvard, Yale and Princeton,[51] and to comparable admissions competition posed by the increasing national popularity of co-ed Stanford,[52] Harvard president Derek Bok reduced the admissions ratio of Harvard students to Radcliffe students from 4:1 to 5:2.[51] That same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students through an experimental program, and in 1972 full co-residence between the two colleges was instituted. The schools\' departments of athletics merged shortly thereafter. By the late 1960s there were open discussions between Radcliffe and Harvard about complete merger of the two institutions—which in truth meant abolition of Radcliffe. However, a merger study committee of the Radcliffe Alumnae Association recommended caution. In a prepared statement, the committee reported that ""it would be a mistake to dissolve Radcliffe at this time. Women\'s self-awareness is increasing as the \'women\'s liberation movement develops and as moderate groups call attention to the life styles and problems particular to women. This is precisely the wrong time to abolish a prestigious women\'s college which should be giving leadership to women as they seek to define and enlarge their role in society.""[53] Instead of a complete merger, in 1977 Radcliffe president Matina Horner and Harvard president Derek Bok signed an agreement that, through their admission to Radcliffe, put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. The so-called ""non-merger merger"" combined the Radcliffe and Harvard admissions offices and ended the forced ceiling on female enrollment. In practice most of the energies of Radcliffe (which remained an autonomous institution) were then devoted to the institution\'s research initiatives and fellowships, rather than to female undergraduates. The Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduate communities and classes came to be known officially as ""Harvard and Radcliffe"" or ""Harvard-Radcliffe"", and female students continued to be awarded degrees signed by both presidents. Radcliffe continued to own its campus and provided financial aid, undergraduate prizes, and externship and fellowship opportunities to Radcliffe students, and the college continued to sponsor academic access programs for high school girls and continuing education opportunities for people outside the traditional college age. The college also continued to support programs and workshops targeting female undergraduates. In practice, though, Radcliffe at this point had minimal impact on the average undergraduate\'s day to day experiences at the university. This minimal role fueled still more talk about a full merger of the two schools. Conversely, supporters of the ""non-merger merger"" maintained that the agreement gave Radcliffe students the full benefits of Harvard citizenship while allowing maintenance of the proud Radcliffe identity, an institution with its own mission, programs, financial resources and alumnae network. On October 1, 1999, Radcliffe College was fully absorbed into Harvard University; female undergraduates were henceforward members only of Harvard College while Radcliffe College evolved into the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.[54] Radcliffe after the merger[edit] The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, now a division of Harvard University, carries on many of the research and professional development programs that Radcliffe College pioneered and has introduced other programs to the worldwide community of scholars. The end of Radcliffe\'s role as an undergraduate institution, however, still has its detractors. ""Although I realize the merger was inevitable,"" a member of the class of 1959 commented, ""...I nevertheless regret the loss of my college, which gave me so much.[55] Another noted that she ""feels sad that Radcliffe College no longer exists. It, far more than Harvard, defined my college experience. I can\'t remember a single Harvard classmate, but two of my best friends are fellow Cliffies and I exchange correspondence with about a dozen more.""[56] Indeed, many Radcliffe alumnae feel their institution has relinquished its distinguished identity in favor of a male-oriented one that remains steadfastly dismissive of women\'s concerns. This latter perspective gained some traction when, in a voice reminiscent of Presidents Eliot and Lowell, Harvard\'s early 21st-century president Lawrence Summers publicly stated that women were not as capable in the sciences as men. Additionally, shortly after full merger of the two schools, Harvard undergraduate women feeling a void in Harvard\'s support for women\'s intellectual and personal development started to lobby Harvard to create a women\'s center. Perhaps not surprisingly, memories of Harvard\'s historical indifference to women have led many Radcliffe alumnae to maintain primary ties to Radcliffe College and not to Harvard University. ""Womenless history has been a Harvard specialty,"" Laurel Thatcher Ulrich noted.[57] The Annex gained some vindication against Presidents Eliot, Lowell, and Summers when Drew Gilpin Faust, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute, replaced Summers and became Harvard\'s first female president. Radcliffe College alumnae continue to press Harvard on the question of the university\'s commitment to women, and increasing the number of female faculty members at Harvard is a particular alumnae interest. Former Radcliffe president Matina Horner once told the New York Times of her surprise when she first delivered a lecture at Harvard in 1969 and four male students approached her. One of these students told her that they ""just wanted to see what it felt like to be lectured by a woman and if a woman could be articulate.""[58] Picking up on the perceived common Harvard blind-eye to women\'s intellectual competence and reflecting on the fact that while at Radcliffe they had had very few female faculty members, in the late 1990s a group of Radcliffe alumnae established the Committee for The Equality of Women at Harvard. The group chose to boycott Harvard\'s fundraising campaigns and sent letters to all 27,000 Radcliffe alumnae and to 13,000 Harvard alumni asking them to shift their donations to an escrow account until the university stepped up its efforts to add women to its tenured faculty. The group has not established quotas that it wants Harvard to meet. Rather, it has stated that individual Harvard departments should measure their percentage of tenured women faculty against a ""realistically available pool"" and create a plan to increase the number of women if that percentage falls short. The group also said that when departments do so, the escrow account (now called the Harvard Women\'s Faculty Fund) will be turned over to Harvard.[59] In the meantime, enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars that Harvard conferred unto Radcliffe at the time of the full merger, the Radcliffe Institute today awards dozens of annual fellowships to prominent academics. Although it does not focus solely on women returning to academe, it is a major research center within Harvard University. Its Schlesinger Library is one of America\'s largest repositories of manuscripts and archives relating to the history of women. Several undergraduate student organizations in Harvard College still refer to Radcliffe in their names, (for example the Radcliffe Union of Students, Harvard\'s feminist organization; the Radcliffe Choral Society, Harvard\'s female choir (now one of the Holden Choirs), which has alumnae from both Radcliffe and Harvard and maintains a repertoire of Radcliffiana; the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra; the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players; the Radcliffe Pitches, a female a cappella singing group; and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club). Two athletic teams still compete under the Radcliffe name: varsity crew, which still rows with Radcliffe\'s black-and-white oarblades and uniforms instead of Harvard\'s crimson-and-white (in 1973 the team had been the only varsity team which voted not to adopt the Harvard name); and club rugby union. In addition, the Harvard University Band still plays a Radcliffe fight song.

With the rise of feminism, enabling women to attend quality institutions became important. Thus, seven liberal arts colleges for women were founded in the late nineteenth century. BY Cherryy Chauhan Radcliffe College Bryn Mawr College Smith College Wellesley College Vassar College Mount Holyoke College Barnard College Established: 1879 Radcliffe College was a private women's college situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On October 1, 1999, Radcliffe College stopped admitting undergraduate students, and officially merged with Harvard College to form the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. Radcliffe was particularly known for its intellectual student body. Several artists such as Josephine Hull (Oscar-winning stage and film actress) and Bonnie Raitt (American blues musician) are Radcliffe alumni. Established: 1885 Bryn Mawr College is a private college for women situated in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. It offers more than 60 academic programs, including dual degree programs (a combination of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science) in partnership with Caltech and Columbia University. The U.S. News & World Report 2017 ranked Bryn Mawr the 31st in the best liberal arts colleges list. Notable alumni of the college include Katherine Hepburn (Academy award winning actress) and Andrea Portes (bestselling American novelist). Established: 1875 Smith College is also a private women's college situated in Northampton, Massachusetts. Apart from on-campus courses, Smith also runs its own year-abroad programs in four European cities - Paris, Hamburg, Florence and Geneva. Smith is the first female college to offer its own undergraduate engineering degree. The U.S. News & World Report 2017 ranked Smith the 12th best liberal arts college (tied with Vassar). Notable alumni of the college include Nancy Reagan (Former First Lady of the United States) and Gloria Steinem (Feminist, activist and journalist). Established: 1875 Wellesley is a private women's college located in the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts. The college offers 56 departmental and interdepartmental courses as well as dual degree programs in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Olin College of Engineering. Thus, students have an opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science degree, along with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The U.S. News & World Report 2017 ranked Wellesley the 3rd best liberal arts college. Notable alumni include Hillary Clinton (former US Secretary of State and the Democratic Party nominee for the 2016 Presidential election) and Soong Mei-ling (the former First Lady of China). Established: 1865 Founded as a private women's college, Vassar became co-educational in 1969. Situated in Poughkeepsie, New York, Vassar's campus comprises of two National Historic Landmarks, as well as an arboretum and an ecological preserve. The U.S. News & World Report 2017 ranked Vassar the 12th best liberal arts college. Notable alumni include Meryl Streep (Academy Award-winning actress) and Lisa Kudrow (Emmy Award-winning actress). Established: 1837 The first of the Seven Sisters colleges, Mount Holyoke is situated in South Hadley, Massachusetts. The U.S. News & World Report 2017 ranked Mount Holyoke the 36th best liberal arts college in the U.S. The college offers 50 departmental and interdepartmental majors, a majority of them lead to a Bachelor of Arts degree. Notable alumni of the college include Dulcy Singer (Emmy Award winning producer of Sesame Street) and Sonali Gulati (Filmmaker and director of the film Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night). Established: 1889 This is also a private women's college in Manhattan, New York. One of the world's oldest women's colleges, it was founded by author Annie Nathan Meyer, as Columbia University refused to admit women. Later, Columbia became co-ed but Barnard remained independent. However, Barnard is closely affiliated with Columbia. Barnard offers BA degrees in about 50 areas of study. The US News & World Report 2017 ranked it as the 29th best liberal arts college in the US. Notable alumni include businesswoman Martha Stewart and comedienne and TV personality Joan Rivers. 1 of 7 Radcliffe College Established: 1879 Radcliffe College was a private women's college situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Adolf AnderssenPersonal informationBornKarl Ernst Adolf Anderssen(1818-07-06)6 July 1818Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia, German ConfederationDied13 March 1879(1879-03-13) (aged\xa060)Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia, German EmpireChess careerCountryPrussia Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (6 July 1818 – 13 March 1879)[1] was a German chess master. He won the great international tournaments of 1851 and 1862, but lost matches to Paul Morphy in 1858, and to Wilhelm Steinitz in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of World Chess Champion did not yet exist. Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50. Anderssen is famous today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the Immortal Game (1851) and the Evergreen Game (1852). He was an important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the ""Old School"" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration. Background and early life[edit] Anderssen was born in Breslau (now called Wrocław, Poland), in the Prussian Province of Silesia, in 1818. He lived there for most of his life, sharing a house with and supporting his widowed mother and his unmarried sister. Anderssen never married. He graduated from the public gymnasium (high school) in Breslau and then attended university, where he studied mathematics and philosophy. After graduating in 1847 at the age of 29, he took a position at the Friedrichs-Gymnasium in Breslau as an instructor and later as professor of Mathematics. Anderssen lived a quiet, stable, responsible, respectable middle-class life. His career was teaching mathematics, while his hobby and passion was playing chess.[2] When Anderssen was nine years old, his father taught him how to play chess.[3] Anderssen said that as a boy, he learned the strategy of the game from a copy of William Lewis\' book Fifty Games Between Labourdonnais and McDonnell (1835).[4] Chess career[edit] First steps[edit] From Anderssen\'s 1842 collection abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghWhite to mate in four moves Solution: 1.Bh5 Kxh5 2.Kg7 h6 3.Kf6 Kh4 4.Kg6# This example uses algebraic notation. Anderssen first came to the attention of the chess world when he published Aufgabe für Schachspieler (""Task for chess players""), a collection of 60 chess problems, in 1842.[2][3] He continued to publish problems for many years, both in magazines and as a second collection in 1852.[5][6] These brought him to the attention of the ""Berlin Pleiades"" group, which included some of the strongest players of the time, and he played matches against some of them.[7] Anderssen\'s development as a player was relatively slow, largely because he could spare neither the time nor the money to play many matches against strong players. Nevertheless, by 1846 he was able to put up a good fight against another Pleiades member, Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who may have been the world\'s strongest player at the time.[8] In 1846, he became the editor of the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) when its founder Ludwig Bledow, one of the Berlin Pleiades, died. Anderssen held this post until 1865.[9] London 1851[edit] Howard Staunton was the principal organiser of the 1851 London International Tournament, and offered to pay Anderssen\'s travel expenses, should he fail to win. In 1848, Anderssen drew a match with the professional player Daniel Harrwitz.[10] On the basis of this match and his general chess reputation, he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However, the tournament\'s principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen\'s travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.[4] Anderssen\'s preparations for the 1851 London International Tournament produced a surge in his playing strength: he played over 100 games in early 1851 against strong opponents including Carl Mayet, Ernst Falkbeer, Max Lange and Jean Dufresne.[8] The 1851 International Tournament was a knock-out event in which pairs of competitors played short matches, and Anderssen won it by beating Lionel Kieseritzky, József Szén, Staunton and Marmaduke Wyvill – by margins of at least two games in every case.[11] His prize was two-thirds of the total prize fund of £500, i.e. about £335;[12] that is equivalent to about £240,000 ($370,200) in 2006\'s money.[13] When Anderssen and Szén found they were to play each other, they agreed that, if either won the tournament, the other would receive one-third of the prize; this does not appear to have been considered in any way unethical.[12] Although most chess books regard Wilhelm Steinitz as the first true world champion,[3] one of the organizers of the 1851 London International Tournament had said the contest was for ""the baton of the World\'s Chess Champion"".[14] In fact Anderssen was not described as ""the world champion"", but the tournament established Anderssen as the world\'s leading chess player.[3] The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organised a tournament that was played a month later and included several players who had competed in the International Tournament. The result was the same – Anderssen won.[15] Morphy match, 1858[edit] Paul Morphy defeated all opposition in 1858. Opportunities for tournament play remained rare, and Anderssen was reluctant to travel far because of the expense.[citation needed] In his one recorded tournament between 1851 and 1862, a one-game-per-round knock-out tournament at Manchester in 1857, he was eliminated in the second round.[15] Then in late 1858, he was beaten 8–3 by the American champion Paul Morphy in a famous match held in Paris, France (two wins, two draws, seven losses).[16] Although Anderssen knew as well as anyone how to attack, Morphy understood much better when to attack and how to prepare an attack. Morphy had recently scored equally convincing wins in matches against other top-class players: Johann Löwenthal, the Rev. John Owen and Daniel Harrwitz.[17] Morphy returned to the United States in 1859, however, and soon afterwards announced his retirement from serious chess, making Anderssen once again the strongest active player.[18] Anderssen played the curious opening move 1.a3 in three games of his match against Morphy, and broke even with it (one loss, one draw, one win).[19] This opening move, now referred to as Anderssen\'s Opening, has never been popular in serious competition.[20] Other games 1851–1862[edit] Shortly after the 1851 London International Tournament, Anderssen played his two most famous games, both casual encounters which he won by combinations that involved several sacrifices. In the first, as White against Lionel Kieseritzky in London on 21 June 1851, just after the International Tournament (1851) and now called the ""Immortal Game"", he sacrificed a bishop, both rooks and finally his queen.[21] In the second, played in Berlin in 1852 as White against Jean Dufresne and now called the ""Evergreen Game"", the total sacrifice was more modest, but still exceeded a queen and a minor piece.[22] After the match with Morphy, Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch, one of the leading players of the time, who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess.[23][24] Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and narrowly won in 1861 (5/9; won four, drew two, lost three; Kolisch was ahead at the half-way stage).[25] London 1862[edit] Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, the first international round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John Owen,[26] and finished two\xa0points ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s.[27][28] Morphy had retired from chess at this time, so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world\'s leading active player.[18] Shortly after the tournament, he played a match against tournament runner-up Paulsen, ending in a draw (3 wins, 3 losses, 2 draws).[29] In 1864, he drew another match (3 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws) against Berthold Suhle,[25] who was a strong player and respected chess writer.[30] Steinitz match, 1866[edit] Wilhelm Steinitz in 1866 In 1866, Anderssen lost a close match with 30-year-old Wilhelm Steinitz (six wins, eight losses, and no draws; Steinitz won the last two games).[31] Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the positional approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority, the 1866 match was played in the attack-at-all-costs style of the 1850s and 1860s.[32] This is generally seen as the point at which Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world\'s leading active player. Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been floating around since the 1840s,[14] the 1866 Anderssen–Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship, and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive. Furthermore, Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments and in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871.[33] 1866–1879[edit] By this time tournaments were becoming more frequent, and the round-robin format was adopted. At the same time, Anderssen, after losing the match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866, rededicated himself to chess, particularly studying both endgames and positional play. The result was that Anderssen, in his early fifties, was playing the finest chess of his career. As a result, Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career: five first places, two second places, two third places; and a sixth place in the final year of his life, when his health was failing.[15][34] One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz, Gustav Neumann, Joseph Henry Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. In terms of the number of leading players present, this could be regarded as one of the top 20 tournaments ever.[35][36] One of Anderssen\'s third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament, when he was 55. About half of Anderssen\'s tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations; but these were open to all nationalities, and most of them had a few top\xa0ten or even top\xa0five competitors.[15] Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches, but his dominance came to an end in 1871. The Leipzig 1877 tournament was organised in his honour and named the ""Anderssen-Feier"" (Anderssen Celebration);[37] Anderssen finished second in the tournament behind Louis Paulsen. Still at Leipzig, Anderssen lost a match against tournament winner Louis Paulsen (three wins, one draw, and five losses). Matches were Anderssen\'s relative weakness; his only match win in this period was in 1868, against the 26-year-old Johann Zukertort (eight wins, one draw, and three losses).[31] Assessment[edit] Playing strength and style[edit] Adolf Anderssen in later life Anderssen was very successful in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in over half of the events in which he played.[15] His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live.[15][34] His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six. Although outclassed by Morphy, and to a lesser extent by Steinitz, Anderssen has been called the first modern chess master.[38] Arpad Elo, inventor of the Elo rating system, retroactively calculated ratings through history, and estimated that Anderssen was the first player with a rating over 2600.[39] Chessmetrics ranks Anderssen as one of the top two players for most of the period from 1859 to 1873, and as the strongest player in the world seven months distributed between 1860 and 1870.[40] Steinitz rated Anderssen as one of the two greatest attacking players of his time: ""We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king\'s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough.""[41] Although Anderssen is regarded as a member of the ""heroic"" attacking school,[7] he was not in favour of mindless aggression, for example he said: ""Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack"",[42] a principle more recently labelled ""Makogonov\'s rule"".[43] According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.[3] Anderssen\'s home town was so proud of him that in 1865 Breslau University awarded him an honourary doctorate.[3] Influence on chess[edit] Anderssen (below, far left) depicted with other leading players Due to the perceived beauty of its attacking style, some of Anderssen\'s games, such as the Immortal Game and the Evergreen Game, are among the most famous in chess history. The ""heroic"" attacking school of play to which Anderssen belonged was eclipsed by Steinitz\' positional approach – by 1894 it was generally acknowledged that the only way to beat Steinitz was to apply Steinitz\' principles.[44] Anderssen has had a more enduring influence on chess problem composition. He started composing in the last years of the ""Old School"", whose compositions were fairly similar to realistic over-the-board positions and featured spectacular key moves, multiple sacrifices and few variations.[6] He was one of the most skillful composers of his time, and his work forms an early stage of the ""Transition Period"", between the mid-1840s and the early 1860s, when many of the basic problem ideas were discovered, the requirement for game-like positions was abandoned and the introduction of composing competitions (the first of which was in 1854) forced judges to decide on what features were the most desirable in a problem.[5] Outside the field of chess problems, Anderssen was not a prolific author. He edited the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) from 1846 to 1865, however, and was co-editor with Gustav Neumann of Neue Berliner Schachzeitung from 1864 to 1867.[9] Personality[edit] It is impossible to keep one\'s excellence in a glass case, like a jewel, and take it out whenever it is required. Adolf Anderssen, 1858[45] Steinitz wrote: ""Anderssen was honest and honourable to the core. Without fear or favour he straightforwardly gave his opinion, and his sincere disinterestedness became so patent....that his word alone was usually sufficient to quell disputes...for he had often given his decision in favour of a rival...""[4] On the other hand, Reuben Fine, a 20th-century player, wrote, ""There is a curious contrast between his over-the-board brilliance and his uninspired safety-first attitude in everyday affairs.""[3] Death[edit] Anderssen died on 13 March 1879, in his home town. The Deutsche Schachzeitung noted his death in 1879 with a nineteen-page obituary. His cause of death was a heart attack.[2] Bombing raids during World War II damaged his grave in Breslau. After the war, the city became part of Poland and is now known under its Polish name Wrocław. In 1957, the Polish Chess Federation decided to re-bury Anderssen in a new grave at the Osobowice Cemetery.[46] Tournament results[edit] Date Location Place Score Notes 1851 London International Tournament 1 15/21 Ahead of Marmaduke Wyvill, Elijah Williams, Howard Staunton, József Szén, Hugh Alexander Kennedy, Bernhard Horwitz, Henry Edward Bird, Lionel Kieseritzky, Carl Mayet, Johann Löwenthal, Edward Löwe, Alfred Brodie, James Mucklow, Samuel Newham and E.S. Kennedy.A knock-out tournament in which the contestants played mini-matches in each round, increasing from best-of-3 in the 1st round to best-of-8 in the final. Anderssen himself beat Kieseritzky, Szen, Staunton and Wyvill – his closest mini-match was +4−2=1 in the final against Wyvill.[11] 1851 London Chess Club Tournament 1 7½/8 Ahead of Karl Meyerhofer, Daniel Harrwitz, Frederick Deacon, Kieseritzky, Horwitz, Szabo, Löwe and Ehrmann. Apparently intended to be round-robin, but the weaker players quickly dropped out. 1857 Manchester (British Chess Association) 3/4 1/2 8-player knock-out tournament in which the contestants played just 1 game in each round. Anderssen beat Harrwitz in the 1st round, and lost to Löwenthal in the 2nd round. Löwenthal drew the final against Samuel Boden, then Boden retired. 1862 London International Tournament 1 12/13 Ahead of Louis Paulsen, (11/13), Rev.

For the Swedish swimmer, see Adolf Andersson. Adolf AnderssenPersonal informationBornKarl Ernst Adolf Anderssen(1818-07-06)6 July 1818Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia, German ConfederationDied13 March 1879(1879-03-13) (aged\xa060)Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia, German EmpireChess careerCountryPrussia Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (6 July 1818 – 13 March 1879)[1] was a German chess master. He won the great international tournaments of 1851 and 1862, but lost matches to Paul Morphy in 1858, and to Wilhelm Steinitz in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world\'s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of World Chess Champion did not yet exist. Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50. Anderssen is famous today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the Immortal Game (1851) and the Evergreen Game (1852). He was an important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the ""Old School"" of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration. Background and early life[edit] Anderssen was born in Breslau (now called Wrocław, Poland), in the Prussian Province of Silesia, in 1818. He lived there for most of his life, sharing a house with and supporting his widowed mother and his unmarried sister. Anderssen never married. He graduated from the public gymnasium (high school) in Breslau and then attended university, where he studied mathematics and philosophy. After graduating in 1847 at the age of 29, he took a position at the Friedrichs-Gymnasium in Breslau as an instructor and later as professor of Mathematics. Anderssen lived a quiet, stable, responsible, respectable middle-class life. His career was teaching mathematics, while his hobby and passion was playing chess.[2] When Anderssen was nine years old, his father taught him how to play chess.[3] Anderssen said that as a boy, he learned the strategy of the game from a copy of William Lewis\' book Fifty Games Between Labourdonnais and McDonnell (1835).[4] Chess career[edit] First steps[edit] From Anderssen\'s 1842 collection abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghWhite to mate in four moves Solution: 1.Bh5 Kxh5 2.Kg7 h6 3.Kf6 Kh4 4.Kg6# This example uses algebraic notation. Anderssen first came to the attention of the chess world when he published Aufgabe für Schachspieler (""Task for chess players""), a collection of 60 chess problems, in 1842.[2][3] He continued to publish problems for many years, both in magazines and as a second collection in 1852.[5][6] These brought him to the attention of the ""Berlin Pleiades"" group, which included some of the strongest players of the time, and he played matches against some of them.[7] Anderssen\'s development as a player was relatively slow, largely because he could spare neither the time nor the money to play many matches against strong players. Nevertheless, by 1846 he was able to put up a good fight against another Pleiades member, Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who may have been the world\'s strongest player at the time.[8] In 1846, he became the editor of the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) when its founder Ludwig Bledow, one of the Berlin Pleiades, died. Anderssen held this post until 1865.[9] London 1851[edit] Howard Staunton was the principal organiser of the 1851 London International Tournament, and offered to pay Anderssen\'s travel expenses, should he fail to win. In 1848, Anderssen drew a match with the professional player Daniel Harrwitz.[10] On the basis of this match and his general chess reputation, he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However, the tournament\'s principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen\'s travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.[4] Anderssen\'s preparations for the 1851 London International Tournament produced a surge in his playing strength: he played over 100 games in early 1851 against strong opponents including Carl Mayet, Ernst Falkbeer, Max Lange and Jean Dufresne.[8] The 1851 International Tournament was a knock-out event in which pairs of competitors played short matches, and Anderssen won it by beating Lionel Kieseritzky, József Szén, Staunton and Marmaduke Wyvill – by margins of at least two games in every case.[11] His prize was two-thirds of the total prize fund of £500, i.e. about £335;[12] that is equivalent to about £240,000 ($370,200) in 2006\'s money.[13] When Anderssen and Szén found they were to play each other, they agreed that, if either won the tournament, the other would receive one-third of the prize; this does not appear to have been considered in any way unethical.[12] Although most chess books regard Wilhelm Steinitz as the first true world champion,[3] one of the organizers of the 1851 London International Tournament had said the contest was for ""the baton of the World\'s Chess Champion"".[14] In fact Anderssen was not described as ""the world champion"", but the tournament established Anderssen as the world\'s leading chess player.[3] The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organised a tournament that was played a month later and included several players who had competed in the International Tournament. The result was the same – Anderssen won.[15] Morphy match, 1858[edit] Paul Morphy defeated all opposition in 1858. Opportunities for tournament play remained rare, and Anderssen was reluctant to travel far because of the expense.[citation needed] In his one recorded tournament between 1851 and 1862, a one-game-per-round knock-out tournament at Manchester in 1857, he was eliminated in the second round.[15] Then in late 1858, he was beaten 8–3 by the American champion Paul Morphy in a famous match held in Paris, France (two wins, two draws, seven losses).[16] Although Anderssen knew as well as anyone how to attack, Morphy understood much better when to attack and how to prepare an attack. Morphy had recently scored equally convincing wins in matches against other top-class players: Johann Löwenthal, the Rev. John Owen and Daniel Harrwitz.[17] Morphy returned to the United States in 1859, however, and soon afterwards announced his retirement from serious chess, making Anderssen once again the strongest active player.[18] Anderssen played the curious opening move 1.a3 in three games of his match against Morphy, and broke even with it (one loss, one draw, one win).[19] This opening move, now referred to as Anderssen\'s Opening, has never been popular in serious competition.[20] Other games 1851–1862[edit] Shortly after the 1851 London International Tournament, Anderssen played his two most famous games, both casual encounters which he won by combinations that involved several sacrifices. In the first, as White against Lionel Kieseritzky in London on 21 June 1851, just after the International Tournament (1851) and now called the ""Immortal Game"", he sacrificed a bishop, both rooks and finally his queen.[21] In the second, played in Berlin in 1852 as White against Jean Dufresne and now called the ""Evergreen Game"", the total sacrifice was more modest, but still exceeded a queen and a minor piece.[22] After the match with Morphy, Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch, one of the leading players of the time, who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess.[23][24] Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and narrowly won in 1861 (5/9; won four, drew two, lost three; Kolisch was ahead at the half-way stage).[25] London 1862[edit] Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, the first international round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John Owen,[26] and finished two\xa0points ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s.[27][28] Morphy had retired from chess at this time, so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world\'s leading active player.[18] Shortly after the tournament, he played a match against tournament runner-up Paulsen, ending in a draw (3 wins, 3 losses, 2 draws).[29] In 1864, he drew another match (3 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws) against Berthold Suhle,[25] who was a strong player and respected chess writer.[30] Steinitz match, 1866[edit] Wilhelm Steinitz in 1866 In 1866, Anderssen lost a close match with 30-year-old Wilhelm Steinitz (six wins, eight losses, and no draws; Steinitz won the last two games).[31] Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the positional approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority, the 1866 match was played in the attack-at-all-costs style of the 1850s and 1860s.[32] This is generally seen as the point at which Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world\'s leading active player. Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been floating around since the 1840s,[14] the 1866 Anderssen–Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship, and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive. Furthermore, Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments and in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871.[33] 1866–1879[edit] By this time tournaments were becoming more frequent, and the round-robin format was adopted. At the same time, Anderssen, after losing the match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866, rededicated himself to chess, particularly studying both endgames and positional play. The result was that Anderssen, in his early fifties, was playing the finest chess of his career. As a result, Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career: five first places, two second places, two third places; and a sixth place in the final year of his life, when his health was failing.[15][34] One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz, Gustav Neumann, Joseph Henry Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. In terms of the number of leading players present, this could be regarded as one of the top 20 tournaments ever.[35][36] One of Anderssen\'s third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament, when he was 55. About half of Anderssen\'s tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations; but these were open to all nationalities, and most of them had a few top\xa0ten or even top\xa0five competitors.[15] Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches, but his dominance came to an end in 1871. The Leipzig 1877 tournament was organised in his honour and named the ""Anderssen-Feier"" (Anderssen Celebration);[37] Anderssen finished second in the tournament behind Louis Paulsen. Still at Leipzig, Anderssen lost a match against tournament winner Louis Paulsen (three wins, one draw, and five losses). Matches were Anderssen\'s relative weakness; his only match win in this period was in 1868, against the 26-year-old Johann Zukertort (eight wins, one draw, and three losses).[31] Assessment[edit] Playing strength and style[edit] Adolf Anderssen in later life Anderssen was very successful in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in over half of the events in which he played.[15] His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live.[15][34] His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six. Although outclassed by Morphy, and to a lesser extent by Steinitz, Anderssen has been called the first modern chess master.[38] Arpad Elo, inventor of the Elo rating system, retroactively calculated ratings through history, and estimated that Anderssen was the first player with a rating over 2600.[39] Chessmetrics ranks Anderssen as one of the top two players for most of the period from 1859 to 1873, and as the strongest player in the world seven months distributed between 1860 and 1870.[40] Steinitz rated Anderssen as one of the two greatest attacking players of his time: ""We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king\'s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough.""[41] Although Anderssen is regarded as a member of the ""heroic"" attacking school,[7] he was not in favour of mindless aggression, for example he said: ""Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack"",[42] a principle more recently labelled ""Makogonov\'s rule"".[43] According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.[3] Anderssen\'s home town was so proud of him that in 1865 Breslau University awarded him an honourary doctorate.[3] Influence on chess[edit] Anderssen (below, far left) depicted with other leading players Due to the perceived beauty of its attacking style, some of Anderssen\'s games, such as the Immortal Game and the Evergreen Game, are among the most famous in chess history. The ""heroic"" attacking school of play to which Anderssen belonged was eclipsed by Steinitz\' positional approach – by 1894 it was generally acknowledged that the only way to beat Steinitz was to apply Steinitz\' principles.[44] Anderssen has had a more enduring influence on chess problem composition. He started composing in the last years of the ""Old School"", whose compositions were fairly similar to realistic over-the-board positions and featured spectacular key moves, multiple sacrifices and few variations.[6] He was one of the most skillful composers of his time, and his work forms an early stage of the ""Transition Period"", between the mid-1840s and the early 1860s, when many of the basic problem ideas were discovered, the requirement for game-like positions was abandoned and the introduction of composing competitions (the first of which was in 1854) forced judges to decide on what features were the most desirable in a problem.[5] Outside the field of chess problems, Anderssen was not a prolific author. He edited the magazine Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft (later called Deutsche Schachzeitung) from 1846 to 1865, however, and was co-editor with Gustav Neumann of Neue Berliner Schachzeitung from 1864 to 1867.[9] Personality[edit] It is impossible to keep one\'s excellence in a glass case, like a jewel, and take it out whenever it is required. Adolf Anderssen, 1858[45] Steinitz wrote: ""Anderssen was honest and honourable to the core. Without fear or favour he straightforwardly gave his opinion, and his sincere disinterestedness became so patent....that his word alone was usually sufficient to quell disputes...for he had often given his decision in favour of a rival...""[4] On the other hand, Reuben Fine, a 20th-century player, wrote, ""There is a curious contrast between his over-the-board brilliance and his uninspired safety-first attitude in everyday affairs.""[3] Death[edit] Anderssen died on 13 March 1879, in his home town. The Deutsche Schachzeitung noted his death in 1879 with a nineteen-page obituary. His cause of death was a heart attack.[2] Bombing raids during World War II damaged his grave in Breslau. After the war, the city became part of Poland and is now known under its Polish name Wrocław. In 1957, the Polish Chess Federation decided to re-bury Anderssen in a new grave at the Osobowice Cemetery.[46] Tournament results[edit] Date Location Place Score Notes 1851 London International Tournament 1 15/21 Ahead of Marmaduke Wyvill, Elijah Williams, Howard Staunton, József Szén, Hugh Alexander Kennedy, Bernhard Horwitz, Henry Edward Bird, Lionel Kieseritzky, Carl Mayet, Johann Löwenthal, Edward Löwe, Alfred Brodie, James Mucklow, Samuel Newham and E.S.

Introduction The German chess federations (Schachbunde) held congresses beginning in 1861. The Westdeutscher Schachbund held 13 events from 1861 to 1880. The Norddeutscher Schachbund held three, from 1868 to 1872. The Mitteldeutscher Schachbund also held three, all in Leipzig, 1871, 1876, 1877. At Leipzig in 1877, leaders of the regional chess federations decided to form a national federation, the Deutscher Schachbund (DSB). A repeat of national DSB tournaments began in 1st DSB Congress, Leipzig (1879) and continued until 1931, whereas the regional tournaments were discontinued after 1880. The Leipzig 1877 event (organized by the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund) was called the Anderssen-Feier and held in honor of Adolf Anderssen. He seemed to have lost none of his strength, finishing =2nd in the tournament. Anderssen won a playoff game with Zukertort for 2nd place and then lost to the first place finisher, Louis Paulsen, in a match by the score of 5 to 3 with one draw. He also played at Paris (1878), finishing 6th in a strong field. He passed away at age 60 in March 1879.Progressive table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 Paulsen, L 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 =2 Anderssen 1.0 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 =2 Zukertort 1.0 1.0 2.0 2.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 4 Winawer 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.5 7.5 5 Goering 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 =7 Englisch 0.5 1.5 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 =7 Schallopp 0.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 =7 Leffmann 1.0 1.5 1.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 9 Metger 0.0 0.5 1.5 1.5 2.0 2.0 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 3.5 10 Flechsig 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 1.5 2.0 2.5 2.5 2.5 3.0 3.0 =11 Franke 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.5 1.5 1.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 =11 Paulsen, W 1.0 1.5 1.5 2.0 2.0 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 Notes The 2nd place playoff game was played on 23 July, see Zukertort vs Anderssen, 1877 Consultation game played 22 July: Paulsen / Goring / Metger vs Anderssen / Zukertort / Schmid, 1877 Offhand games played in Leipzig 14 July: Anderssen vs E Schallopp, 1877, E Schallopp vs Anderssen, 1877, Anderssen vs E Schallopp, 1877 Anderssen - Paulsen (1877) was arranged with the remainder of the prize fund.

Jun-03-15\xa0\xa0thomastonk: There are some German language errors in the introduction.The plural of \'Bund\' is \'Bunde\' or \'BÃ¼nde\'. So, the chess federations in the very first sentence are Schachbunde or SchachbÃ¼nde.The Westdeutsche<r> Schachbund ...The Norddeutsche<r> Schachbund ...The Mitteldeutsche<r> Schachbund ...I don\'t understand <The Leipzig 1877 Mitt<le>deutschen Schachbund>. If it is meant as a name for the tournament, then it is wrong.In July 1876(!), the Mitteldeutscher Schachbund held his second congress. There the idea was born to celebrate Anderssen\'s 50th chess anniversary. All German chess clubs were invited to support the event, and many did so.The German name of the event was: die Anderssen-Feier (the Anderssen festivity). Dec-30-15\xa0\xa0ndg2: They did not draw very much back then, did they? Mar-18-16\xa0\xa0zanzibar: <Bestimmungen fÃ¼r die einzelnen Turniere.I. Meisterturnier.

Concloosuve proof dat players were BETTER back in da olden days before da cumpoters took over! Aug-29-18\xa0\xa0bobmeadley: The 1877 Leipzig photo in Gottschall is a beauty but has some mistakes. For example where is Schottlander? He is not there but is named in the photo. There are 38 faces and 39 names. Another mistake is R.Wuttig. This is R.Wuttke a very strong chess player. Looking at the names take a vertical line to the faces from the centre of the name and that gets the face. Note also Hermann Zwanzig who is in the back row in front and left of the right statue (The balding man).He was a giant of German chess and the secretary of the German Chess Association.This photo is on a website for anyone to look at.How nice to see Curt von Bardeleben at age 15 and R.v Bardeleben who may be his father. One of the very best tourney photos and whoever took it did a great job.I have dug a lot out of Jeremy Gaige on dates of birth and death to determine ages. Gaige\'s book is really good. Aug-29-18\xa0\xa0bobmeadley: On Schottlander, whilst he isn\'t in the 1877 Leipzig photo he was a very talkative man and gets a mention in Chess Monthly August 1892 for his \'exuberant spirit\'. I can\'t read German but this doggerel was above the door of the Dresden Chess Club.Can someone translate it? Erste Regel Ist Beim Schach, Merke Dir Die Mahnung, Duss Du Habest Von Der Schach, Irgend Welche Ahnung. Leo Hoffer said it was good advice for young chessplayers.My apologies if I have any word wrong. Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0whiteshark: <bobmeadley: doggerel>First rule in chess is, Remember the warning, That you have of chess, Any idea. sort of <good advice for young chessplayers> ;) Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0zanzibar: < Erste Regel Ist Beim Schach, Merke Dir Die Mahnung, Duss Du Habest Von Der Schach, Irgend Welche Ahnung. > Google translate gives basically the same: < First rule is chess, Remember the admonition Did you get the chess, Any idea. > But what exactly does the ""Did you get the chess, any idea"" mean?It must be obvious to Germans, but not to me. . Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0sneaky\xa0pete: <zanzibar> It means nothing, that Google translation is plain rotten, as usual. The <whiteshark> translation is not perfect but much better.Duss in the third line is a typo for dass or daÃ\x9f, this may have confused Google. Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0ChessHigherCat: <sneaky pete> Welcome back! How\'s this?The first rule in chess is to be forewarned that you know nothing about it. Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0sneaky\xa0pete: <CHC> That was my first idea too when I read it and it \'s very true of course, but shouldn\'t the last line then be ""Irgend keine Ahnung""? Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0Z\xa0truth: Is it saying that one should always have a plan?Or an idea of what the move is doing? Or ... ??? Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0ChessHigherCat: <sneaky pete> Yeah, I think he should get his poetic license suspended. I tried to Google it but all I came up with are Bob Meadly\'s and zanzibar\'s posts above. But that must be what it means because Bob Meadly says it\'s supposed to be good advice for young people. Feb-06-19\xa0\xa0jith1207: So, <Sneaky Pete> isn\'t <Sneaky>!!Finally, redeemed. Feb-07-19\xa0\xa0ChessHigherCat: < jith1207: So, <Sneaky Pete> isn\'t <Sneaky>!!<Finally, redeemed.>You were right but it seems obvious because <Sneaky Pete> is a native speaker of Dutch but <Sneaky> isn\'t, unless it\'s a hidden talent. Just search their respective <user name> + <Dutch> and you\'ll find lots of examples. Feb-07-19\xa0\xa0jith1207: Yes, I know. But as I had learned of Sneaky having an immediate European origin and Sneaky Pete hadn\'t logged in for months at that time, the coincidence seemed to give credence to that suspicion. Anyways, I totally forgot about it and didn\'t realize he has been posting for few months now. All is well then. Feb-07-19\xa0\xa0Z\xa0truth: I\'m getting a feeling of deja vu all over again.Though I did think we had sorted all this out at the time. But it was confusing, and <Sargon> could have set the record straight with just a post or two at the time, but didn\'t.. Feb-08-19\xa0\xa0jith1207: <Sargon> was going through a sudden loss of a life-long friend, more than any of us around here. We need to account for the privacy everyone needed at that time. This is not even an issue, just confirming that it\'s all good. Feb-10-19\xa0\xa0zanzibar: Yes, but when <Daniel> died we all lost a friend, and <CG> lost its soul. Feb-11-19\xa0\xa0jith1207: That happens, I see the soul of this site as the users themselves, I never saw the founders as soul of this website even though they spent every time they had every single day. This is a great community, but eventually the old guard will have to leave one by one - which we have begun to realize sadly - and the new members will need to carry the torch as the founders intended. It\'s about the harmony among the community that will keep the legacy alive forever. Feb-11-19\xa0\xa0ChessHigherCat: <jith1207: the new members will need to carry the torch as the founders intended.>And not use it to torch the entire edifice, as the friendly local agitators would like to do.

Friedrich August von Kaulbach: Elisabeth on Corfu, pastel on paper, after 1898 View of the sea from the garden of the Achilleion, with a bust of Elisabeth in the foreground, photomontage, 19th century When Elisabeth, the emperor’s wife and indeed Empress of Austria, relocated to Greece, permanently turning her back on her consort and the Monarchy, this not surprisingly met with scant approval from Franz Joseph. But Elisabeth had decided in future to lead a life ‘devoted only to quiet contemplation’. The ‘screaming Greek’, the ‘hunchback’, the ‘perfumed one’ and ‘stumpy pins’, as the emperor scornfully referred to his wife’s Greek teacher, prepared her for her new life through intensive studies of Greek language and culture. As a result of the fascinating excavations and publications of eminent German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, famous for his discovery of Troy, an interest in Greek antiquity became fashionable in the 1870s and 1880s, and this also triggered Elisabeth’s enthusiasm for the ancient world. And so Elisabeth had a palatial villa erected on Corfu – an immense financial burden on the emperor’s private purse. Archaeological finds served as models for the architects. The furniture was modelled on specimens from antiquity in the style of Pompeii, and turned out to be extremely uncomfortable. Only the rooms planned for Franz Joseph were furnished with modern furniture. However, the emperor never visited his wife in Corfu. A monument to Achilles, Elisabeth’s favourite hero of Greek mythology, and after whom the villa was named, was erected in front of the building. Other busts showed poets and philosophers revered by Elisabeth, including Homer, Shakespeare and Heine. Scarcely had the Achilleion been completed than the empress, disenchanted, remarked: ‘Our dreams are always lovelier when we do not realize them.’ And so, six years after completion of the construction work, she abandoned Corfu. She urged that the villa be sold, but Franz Joseph refused to part with it. Following her death, the estate passed to her daughter Gisela, who sold it to the German Emperor Wilhelm II. Thereafter, the building went through a variety of different uses, serving as a diplomatic centre under Wilhelm II, barracks in the First World War, seat of the German occupying forces in the Second World War before becoming a casino. Today, as a museum, the Achilleion is once more dedicated to the memory of Elisabeth.

L ■ >*\'»X AND Tilcln founoamons. 1899 Sprinted by Hiizell, Watson, & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesburj*, PREFACE. r WHEN I undertook to write a memoir of the late Empress of Austria, I was fully aware of the great difficulties I should encounter, especially as the material I had collected from various quarters was enormous, and I felt it to be my duty to sift it thoroughly and to select only such parts as I could myself believe to be authentic. I have personally had the happiness of meeting the illustrious lady who is the subject of my sketch ; I have seen her on many occasions and followed with interest the vicissitudes of her life for the last thirty years ; I have often had occasion to write about her, and have also had the privilege of knowing some of those who were in her entourage^ and who, from time to time, have given me news, anecdotes, and reminiscences of the woman .<5 they loved with all their heart and soul. I am enabled to give some photographs from life 7 8 Preface and from pictures, which, I believe, are not public property, and for the reproduction of which I have received special permission. It is well known that the Empress had a great aversion to being photo- graphed, especially during the latter part of her life, and it will therefore greatly interest my readers to see the reproduction of a photograph taken of Her Majesty when walking with the Emperor at Kissingen only a few months before her death. Even that photograph had to be instantaneous, for she was prepared with a .fan and sunshade to prevent her portrait being taken. In respect to Chapters XIII. and XIV., the various reports I have had from eye-witnesses coincide so fully with those published at the time in the daily press, that I have largely quoted from them, and have used principally the reports as they appeared in the Daily Telegraph.

And amongst the array of tragedies he will have to record the murder of a woman who, though occupying an exalted position, was essentially a friend of the 13 1 4 Introduction people, and especially of the poor, the miserable, and the suffering, with whom she was ever in sympathy, and for whom she seemed to live. The writing of the life-story of the late Empress Elizabeth of Austria, Queen of Hungary, is to me a labour of love: I have ever admired her as I saw her pass through the different stages of her career ; I have had many times the privilege of seeing and observing her and her doings ; I have felt for her the most sincere sympathy in the times of her suffering, she has had my heart-felt good wishes in the time of her joy ; I have been fully aware of her unostenta- tious work of benevolence ; I have closely followed her many deeds of generosity and unselfishness, and of many of them I have become personally cognisant ; I have seen her making the woes of others her own, and doing all in her power to alleviate the grief and pain of her neighbours, were they her own people, or were they strangers — her kindness of heart knew no limits. Is it not an appalling irony of life, that the beautiful and lonely Empress, who for so many years had wandered from place to place doing good — who, remote from all the distractions of politics and Court life, Introduction 1 5 herself scourged by so many unspeakable sorrows, only seeking for peace and rest for her troubled soul, appeal- ing to the sympathy of mankind — should have been assassinated in cold blood by an obscure ruffian, who had no other grudge against her but that he hated all whose position was better than his own ? It is never an easy task to write a biography of any one who has just departed this life ; and it becomes especially difficult when one feels that one cannot do full justice to the subject, that it is impossible to adequately describe a life so beautiful, so interesting, as that which I shall try to represent in this memoir. It would be difficult to find any woman in this century who has been overwhelmed by such terrible events as those that mercilessly followed the late Empress ; and to say this means much, for there are now living some women who have not only lost their beloved ones, but their thrones as well. I have endeavoured in one of the chapters of this work to crowd into a limited space the misfortunes of the late Empress of Austria: naturally I can only speak of a few of the more important ones. As an affisctionate wife she shared, as a matter of course, all the troubles and worries of her imperial spouse, and 1 6 Introduction felt it ever her duty to stand by him with consolation and love, and so make less bitter the cup it was his fate to drink. Nothing can be more characteristic and pathetic than her description of her condition of mind to one of her intimates some years ago. "" When one has no wish to live longer,"" she said, *\' one is in reality not alive.\'* Then she added : "" There is in life for every one a moment when he dies inwardly, and it is not necessary that this should happen only at the death of the body."" The love that she had for her son, and the hope that had centred in his career, were indescribable. What his terrible death meant to her is expressed in her own words just quoted ; her heart was slain. Undoubtedly the Empress had the strange tempera- ment of the Wittelsbach family to which she belonged ; by this the intense sympathy that existed between her and King Ludwig, her cousin, may be explained — it could only spring from a certain sense of kinship of spirit. One of our great psychologists remarked, as the outcome of long observations, "" The unhappy flee where no man pursueth."" And so it was with poor Elizabeth ; she appeared haunted and chased by sad Introduction 1 7 memories, by the phantoms of past hopes and dead affections, and she became a wanderer, seeking in vain for rest. Her sense of duty was strongly developed, and her liberal ideas have certainly done much to shed lustre upon the era of Francis Joseph. It is true she rarely took any part in politics, but she improved the social reputation of her Court, and in no small measure contributed to the extraordinary popularity of the Emperor, having greatly assisted him in winning the love and attachment of his heterogeneous subjects; and no one has acknowledged this more readily than Francis Joseph himself. It was a fact especially observable in Elizabeth, that whenever called upon to become the consoler of her husband her strength never failed her ; and however terrible the reaction may have been afterwards, she was always ready to stand by his side, when it became necessary either to impart to him grievous news or to encourage him in the bearing of them. The Empress-Queen had been all her life a staunch adherer of the Roman Catholic Church ; she hardly ever passed a day without hearing Mass, and she ever found great consolation in hdr religion ; but by no means 2 1 8 Introduction was she narrow-minded, and amongst her greatest friends she numbered Protestants, Jews, and even Mohammedans. As we are aware, she had just come from a visit to her friend the Baroness Rothschild, who has a most charming villa on the shore of Lake Leman, when she fell a victim to the murderer\'s steel. In her deeds of benevolence she knew no creed — all sufferers were alike to her ; and perhaps in that very fact she showed that she was a true follower of the Great Teacher. CHAPTER I. THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH OF BA VARIA 19 CHAPTER I. THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH OF BA VARIA. ON the shores of the Lake of Staretiberg, not far from the Bavarian capital, Munich, in the midst of a charming landscape of mountain and vale, surrounded by a park and beautiful gardens, bordering on picturesque forests of beech trees, there stands the Castle of Possenhofen, which nestles on the lake side among the roses and flowers which have made those regions renowned. This castle was once the home of the late Empress of Austria. Duke Maxi- milian of Bavaria and his wife lived here the life of a country squire and squiress, happy in the midst of a family of boys and girls, some of whom have been called to fill most exalted positions, and whose names have become well known for their intrepid deeds, their physical strength and endurance and philanthropy. To-day the visitor to the castle and park will be reminded of some of the romances which occurred among the shady avenues and beautiful rose gardens of this charming spot ; he will see before his mind\'s 21 12 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria eye the sprightly Princess Elizabeth, her more serious elder sister Helen, the younger happy children chasing each other through the avenues and rose walks of the gardens, and the boys playing the games of happy childhood. It is reported that Elizabeth was the favourite child of her father, and his constant companion on his excursions in the mountainous districts. Duke Maxi- milian was a scientist and student ; but he did not disdain recreations, and found happiness in moving amongst the peasants of his neighbourhood, to whom he often would play on his zither, frequently accompanied by his daughter Elizabeth. The girl grew up a lover of nature, a child of the woods, loving to wander about on the mountain sides or racing a pony along the shores of the lake. She had the happiest of childhoods, being allowed to run wild with her brothers amongst the Bavarian Alps, where she learned to ride and row and run as they did, and formed that taste for athletic exercises which distinguished her through life. She was troubled little with education, and in later years would laughingly declare that at that time she was the most ignorant princess in Europe, as she knew nothing save the rudiments of some half-dozen languages and what she had picked up at the knee of her father. I need not say that her modesty was somewhat exaggerated. The Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 23 The Duchess Ludovica, Elizabeth\'s mother, and sister of the Archduchess Sophie, mother of Francis Joseph, was a proud, ambitious woman, and had centred all her hopes on her eldest daughter, whom she had resolved should be Empress of Austria ; and when some duenna approached her with the information that the Duchess Elizabeth was masquerading with her brothers, and had played the zither on the hill side while the peasants danced to the strains of her instrument, or had been belated in the mountains and had spent the night in a deserted hut. Her Royal Highness would smile indifferently, and say she would take the child in hand later on, but for the present was too much occupied to attend to her. I 24 EUzabetht Empress of Austria How the young Princess loved to climb the rugged peaks of the Alps, and to gather the Edelweiss and other Alpine flowers, is still related amongst the peasantry of the district. She was not devoted to study, which seemed slow to her; she preferred the lessons she received from observation and contempla- tion of nature itself. As a matter of fact she was not brought up to fill the exalted position to which she was afterwards called ; and but for her graceful beauty Elizabeth of Bavaria would certainly have escaped the notice of her cousin, the then young Emperor of Austria, whose troth was currently re- ported to be pledged to her elder sister, Helen. Elizabeth\'s marriage was a love match, at any rate on one side, and most likely on both ; and that it proved a most beneficent one for the Emperor is well known, and has frequently been confirmed by himself in addresses to his subjects. However this may be, no young princess declines the hand of such an emperor as Francis Joseph. Never, even among the most romantic of the romantic middle classes — for it is a libel to say that middle-class young people are not romantic — was a young fellow so much in love with his fiancee as was Francis Joseph with his sixteen- year-old bride. The Emperor nourished the most passionate and chivalrous devotion for the beautiful Elizabeth, whom he had discovered for himself without The Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 25 the aid of ambassador or foreign minister, as he used laughingly to boast to members of his house, when there was a question of this alliance or that being arranged for him by the diplomatic statesmen. It needed all his love, however, to reconcile his high- spirited youthful consort to her new position. Duke Maximilian was in the habit of spending the winter at his beautiful palace in Munich, but Elizabeth was never happy there. Although the apartments were of large dimensions and beautifully adorned with frescoes by Kaulbach, the Princess always thought them narrow ; she often said that she could not breathe in those small rooms, and used to enjoy principally to run about in the large riding school which was attached to the palace. Here she loved what she called \'* play- ing circus."" She mounted and rode the most restive and unmanageable horses, and did not seem to know what fear was. Once she was thrown by one of the blood horses ; a cry of terror sounded through the arena ; but the little Duchess, not in the least frightened, jumped up from the ground where she had landed, and smilingly begged to be allowed to mount the horse again, which wish was not granted by her frightened governess. The Duchess Ludovica was a sister of King Ludwig I. of Bavaria, and was for more than fifty years the popular and universally beloved mistress of 26 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Possenhofen. She was highly intellectual, well known for her wit and intelligence, and it was no doubt due to the fact that she personally undertook to superintend the education of her children that they all displayed a great love for science and art. Princess Elizabeth Amalie Eugenie, the late Empress, was the second daughter of Duke Maximilian and his wife Ludovica Maria, and was born on the 24th of December, 1837 — a date which is considered to be of ill omen in many parts of the world. As already mentioned, her father devoted his life to the study of natural history, national economy, and history. Both Princess "" Lisel,"" as the late Empress was called, and her eldest brother, Ludwig, were quite different from the other members of the family ; they were full of life and wit, but the others were serious and studious. Prihcess Elizabeth was considered a dreamer, like her second brother, Charles Theodore. She was such a sensitive and affectionate child that both parents could not help spoiling her to a very great extent ; but from her very first youth she showed a great pre- dilection for the pleasures nature can ofl^er and for country life. When but little over fifteen years of age, she undertook her first journey. With her mother and her sisters she went to Ischl to spend the summer, where the parents of Francis Joseph also had their summer residence. It was rumoured that the visit THEN PUBLi\' The Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 29 of the ducal family was not without purpose, and the Duchess was fondly hoping to see the crown of an empress placed upon the brow of her eldest daughter, Helen. On the 1 6th of August, 1853, a most lovely summer day, the Emperor appeared quite unexpectedly at that popular summer resort. Although it was his habit to spend a month there every year with his parents, his unlooked-for arrival embarrassed the Bavarian ladies not a little, as they were apparently not prepared with the necessary wardrobe for the reception of so exalted a guest, and everything possible was done to furnish Princess Helen with such finery as would suit her high position and make her appear at her best. Elizabeth had been out for a walk, and, returning, entered unannounced, as usual, the apartments of her aunt, the Archduchess Sophie, the mother of Francis Joseph, where she always found some dainties prepared for her special delectation. Her cheeks the colour of a sun-kissed peach, a large bouquet of wild flowers in her hand, she ran into the salon ; without the slightest embarrassment she immediately recognised the Emperor from the portraits she had seen, and, running up to him, she exclaimed in a clear child\'s voice, "" God greet thee, cousin ! "" The Emperor was enchanted by the charming / 30 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria apparition ; and when Princess Helen, decked out to perfection, entered the salon, she was too late — the Emperor of Austria had neither hand nor heart to bestow upon her. On the same evening a carriage arrived at the villa to take a party out for a drive to a near-lying village. The Emperor placed a shawl upon his mother\'s shoulders, and at the same time slipped off from her arm a . diamond bangle which she wore, whispering to her, \'\' This we shall lay under E]izabeth*s serviette at tea."" The Archduchess Sophie at once understood the situation ; she did not put a single question to her son ; and when the next morning the Archduchess went to Mass with her Bavarian relatives, she stepped back at the door and allowed Princess Elizabeth to enter first. That was a public announcement of the great event more pronounced than if it had been given out in the Official Gazette. But when the Mass was ended the youthful Emperor took the child-Princess Elizabeth by her hand and led her up to the altar, and meeting the officiating priest as he came down the steps, said to him, "" Pastor, please bless us ; this is my intended bride."" On the 23 rd of August the Vienna Gazette published the first official news of the betrothal. The Duchess Helen of Bavaria married afterwards the Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and died eight years i THEN PUBLIC L. » - \' K ABTOk. l •> ^no 7 The Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 32 ago ; her son, the present Prince Albert, is married to an Austrian archduchess, known in England as an authoress, having published in English a well-known work on the Austrian mountain districts, and who has one son, Prince Francis Joseph. The betrothal of the sixteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth to the Emperor, who was twenty-three and a man of extreme good looks and figure, was very popular, both in Bavaria and Austria. It is generally accepted as a fact that the young bride was at that time the most beautiful princess in Christendom. It is told that, when Elizabeth was informed that she should be Empress, she exclaimed, "" It cannot be possible ; I am such an insignificant little thing "" ; but when her aunt assured her that Francis Joseph was absolutely in earnest, and would have no other wife but "" Lisel,*\' she joyfully accepted the Emperor-King\'s proposal, and three days afterwards the betrothal of the young couple was solemnly consecrated in the palace chapel of Ischl. Eight months later they were wedded at St. Augustine\'s by the Prince Archbishop of Vienna amidst public rejoicings, in which the whole population of Austria participated, the City Council giving general expression of its loyal gladness by liberally dowering forty penniless brides whose nuptial rites were celebrated on the day of the imperial wedding. When the Emperor, shortly after his betrothal, met 3 34 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Count O\'Donnell, who had saved his life at the time the insane Libenye had attempted to murder him, he addressed the young Austro-Irish officer thus : "" In my happiness I to-day thank you again with all my heart that you have saved my life."" At the time the betrothal became known at Ischl, the people seemed almost unable to show sufficiently their joy and happiness over the event. On the young Emperor returning with his bride one night from an excursion from Hallstadt, the whole town was magnifi- cently illuminated ; the Austrian and Bavarian colours were gracefully intertwined, and thousands upon thousands of lamps were placed along the roads and streets and promenades ; and from the heights and peaks of the surrounding mountains beacons threw their glare, and upon the highest peak of all a temple in beautiful classic style, surmounted by an imperial crown over the united initials of the royal bridegroom and bride, was traced out in many-coloured lamps, which showed their radiance for miles around. The winter following his engagement the young sovereign frequently visited Munich, where his bride sojourned ; and the populace of the Bavarian capital testified by their many ovations and demonstrations of joy how pleased they were that one of the daughters of their own country should be selected to be the first Catholic lady of Europe and consort of the proudest A8T0R, LtNOX ANL TILDEN FOUND/ T.C .- -- -► The Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria 37 of its rulers. The Emperor\'s last visit to Munich was on the 9th of March, 1854. When he left the ducal palace eight days later in an open carriage drawn by six horses, to commence his journey back to Vienna, he stood up in his carriage, and looked back to the upper storey of the residence, where there stood at the window in all her radiant beauty and youth the woman who was in future to share joy and grief with him. Taking off his military cap and swinging it towards his bride, and throwing a kiss with his other -hand, he called with loud voice, "" Au revoir ; in five weeks thou shalt be mine at Vienna ! "" It may prove interesting to trace the lives of the sisters and brothers of the late Empress, other than the eldest, of whom I have just spoken. The next in age, Princess Maria Sophia, is the ex-Queen of the Two Sicilies; she married the Crown Prince of Naples, after- wards Francis II., in 1859, and greatly distinguished herself by her bravery and intrepidity during the siege of Gaeta by the Garibaldian and Italian troops. Princess Matilda Louisa married Prince Louis of Bourbon, Count of Trani, in 1861, who was brother of King Francis II., and has been a widow for the past twelve years, her husband having committed suicide by drowning himself in a fit of temporary insanity. The youngest. Princess Sophie Charlotte, was the betrothed bride of the unfortunate King I 38 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria * Ludwig II. of Bavaria, until he suddenly and mysteri- ously broke off his engagement ; she afterwards wedded the Due d\'Alen^^on (in 1868), and was one of the victims of the memorable conflagration at the Charity Bazaar which plunged the French aristocracy into mourning not long ago. There were also three brothers: Duke Ludwig William, who in 1859 ^^"" nounced his right of succession upon contracting a morganatic marriage with an actress ; Duke Charles Theodore, the renowned oculist and philanthropist, and present head of the ducal house of Bavaria, who resides in Tegernsee in Bavaria ; and Duke Maximilian, who died in 1893. I have had occasion to say before that the Princess Elizabeth preferred roaming through the woods and forests to sitting at a desk to study, but she nevertheless displayed remarkable talent as a student of natural science, geography, drawing, painting, and music, and excelled in the practice of many physical exercises, particularly horsemanship and swimming. She was also all her life a great pedestrian. CHAPTER II. THE EMPRESS ELIZABETH, -V^i CHAPTER II. THE EMPRESS ELIZABETH, ON the 24th of April, 1854, the Princess Elizabeth of Bavaria became Empress of Austria, the wife of the proudest of all monarchs of Europe, — the Apostolic King of Hungary ; King of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Illyria, and Jerusalem ; a Duke, Prince, or Lord of a hundred other places, and the possessor of more titles than any other sovereign ; a man through whose veins flows the blood of all the great reigning families, Bourbon, Plantagenet, and Stuart, as well as that of a hundred Roman Emperors. The imperial bride arrived at Schonbrunn from Linz in Upper Austria, whence she had taken a steamer, which brought her down the beautiful blue Danube. She landed on Saturday at Nussdorf, near Vienna, where she was met by the Emperor in person. The solemnisation of the imperial nuptials took place in the Court Church of St. Augustine by the Cardinal Prince Archbishop of Vienna, and the greatest 41 4^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria enthusiasm prevailed amongst the populace. The girl bride won the hearts of all ; and the greater was the love borne for her when it became known that she had begged of the Emperor, as the first favour to be granted to the wife, the release of the political prisoners, three hundred and fifty-six of whom received pardon. All criminal suits in Galicia for treason were quashed, and similar suits for oflFences against His Majesty were erased entirely after the ist of May. According to an ancient custom, the bride drove in great state from the Theresianum, where she had arrived early in the morning, to the imperial castle, and was received by a most brilliant assembly, gathered together to do honour to their future Queen. The pageant moved over a new stone bridge, which was named after her the "" Elizabeth Bridge."" By a strange coincidence this bridge was demolished this year (1898), and so has ceased to exist in the same year as she who had given it her name. The bride wore a pale pink satin dress, beautifully embroidered with silver and adorned with white roses, a white lace shawl, and a most brilliant diamond tiara, which was only partly visible under a wreath of white and red roses. The pomp of the ceremony surpassed anything seen during this century, and the banquet which followed was one of the most magnificent functions recorded in the annals of our times. The 1 \\ 1 A - *. - - The Empress Elizabeth 45 wedding took place at 6.30 p.m. The scene was brilliant in the extreme, — the white, red, and blue uniforms of the generals ; the gorgeous national cos- tumes of the Hungarian and Polish nobles ; the exquisite dresses of the ladies ; interspersed with the thickly gold-embroidered costumes of the Privy Coun- cillors, Ministers, and Chamberlains ; the scarlet of the Cardinals, and violet of the Bishops ; the various, rich, and even fantastic apparel of the Ambassadors and Ministers, combined to form a fairy-like picture of over- whelming grandeur. There were present more than seventy archbishops and bishops, all bedecked with the splendid garments of cloth of gold which are on such occasions used in the Roman ceremonial. At the entry of the bridal couple the Cardinal Archbishop offered them the holy water, with which they crossed themselves, afterwards taking their places under a rich canopy of gold and velvet. The service lasted about half an hour, after which the thunder of cannon announced to the people that the Princess Elizabeth had become Empress of Austria. The Emperor and Empress moved now into the Throne Room of the Palace (the Church of St. Augustine adjoins the castle), where the former in- troduced to the Empress the renowned and venerable Field-Marshal Count Radetzky, Prince Windischgratz, and the great Croatian hero Jelacic, these three being 46 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria at the time the greatest in the Empire. Afterwards the Empress received the Ambassadors and Ministers and their wives, generals and high officials, officers and deputations from the various provinces. After their marriage their Imperial Majesties travelled through Hungary and the Austrian Crown lands, the tour proving a never-ending triumphal procession. It was reported at the time, and not without truth, that the enthusiastic receptions accorded to her, at least in Vienna, were far more a personal compliment to the young Empress than an expression of loyalty ; in fact, the aristocracy of Austria thought that a Princess from a collateral branch of the Bavarian house was not good enough for the Emperor, and they did not disguise their feelings. The arrogant nobles of Vienna actually formed a clique against her, with the natural result that the young couple reserved their smiles and cordial greetings for Buda-Pesth, the second city in the realm, where, in direct contrast to the coolness of the patrician circles in Vienna, the young Princess was literally worshipped. Soon after Francis Joseph and Elizabeth had been united in matrimony, and when the youthful beauty and affiibility of the Empress had overcome the adverse feeling entertained by some against her, she was acknowledged to be not only the most beautiful ^ 1-. - — The Empress Elizabeth 49 woman but also the most popular queen in Europe ; she had a noble bearing, a most fascinating and charming face, encircled by glossy chestnut hair of extraordinary length and thickness, and in addition to rare personal charms she had also great mental gifts, which impressed every one who came in contact with her. Like her husband\'s great-aunt, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, the Empress refused to comply with the strict rules of etiquette. Some of the women of the bed-chamber who were on duty at that time remember to this day what sensations the young Empress created because she would insist on wearing her boots a month or longer, instead of stretching a new pair every day for those who thought that they had a right to them ; for according to the ancient customs of the Court the Empress could wear a pair of boots but once. These said demure creatures of the then most buck- ram Court of Europe were positively shocked at the indifference to all established rules which the young sovereign displayed. At the first State dinner, contrary to all custom, she took ofF her gloves. An elderly Court lady remarked quietly upon it to the young Empress. ""Why not.^"" she asked. ""Because it is a deviation from the rules,"" was the answer. ""Then let the 4 50 Elizabeth, . Empress of Austria deviation henceforth be the rule,"" was the retort ; and not that deviation only, but many more, hence- forth became the rule, because the new Empress was not an ordinary Princess — she was clever and accom- plished in the highest degree, and her will was law : she knew her position. \' There was never any doubt that the Empress had no love for the life of state and ceremonial which she had to lead when at home. This was often trying to the patient and loving husband, and sometimes it was supposed that their relations were strained ; but innumerable instances prove beyond all doubt that it was not so ; and the rumours which some thirty years ago made their appearance from time to time, to the effect that there existed a serious misunder- standing on account of some adventure of the Emperor\'s, are also discredited by those who ought to know. There is very little if any truth in the tales made up and spread by gossip-mongers, who unfortunately are here and everywhere, and to whom no man or woman is sacred. It will be difficult to believe these stories in the face of the open exhibition of mutual affection displayed on so many occasions by the imperial couple. Life at the Court of the Habsburgs did not at first offer to the simple-minded Elizabeth the unalloyed happiness she had expected to find at the side of a THENEWYORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, A8TOR, LENOX AND -^ r r r i The Empress Elizabeth 53 husband whose love she sincerely reciprocated. I have already mentioned how she came to disagreements with her ladies-in-waiting and Court officials. She created quite a consternation amongst them when she flatly refused to partake of the luncheon consisting of various dainty dishes prepared in the imperial kitchen, and ordered instead some Frankfort sausages and a glass of lager beer, the fare to which she was accustomed. There were many subjects of contention between the imperial bride and the old-fashioned duennas of the Court. It often became necessary for the Emperor to interfere on behalf of his young spouse, and he permitted her to introduce new forms and to lighten the stern rigour of the existing regime. So it came to pass that soon a different tone prevailed in Court circles ; and in spite of the venerable mother of the young Emperor, who up to now had been the real mistress of the royal palace, and who opposed any relaxation, and in spite of all the powerful rule of the Jesuits, the Court of Vienna became gay and lively. Through her influence over her husband the Empress not only caused reforms in their own home, but she also prevailed upon him to greatly alleviate the sad position of prisoners and soldiers who had merited punishment. Chains and corporal punishment were done away with, especially the brutal castigation of 54 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria soldiers, called "" Gassenlau fen,"" ^ against which she set her face, and the abolishment of which she demanded, and it was readily granted by her loving spouse as a wedding present. Then, too, the treatment of the poor in the hospitals was strictly investigated, and vast improvements made in that quarter, as a conse- quence of the interference of Her Majesty on behalf of the suffering poor. However much Court ceremonies and festivities may have been uncongenial to the Empress, she nevertheless played her part in them for over thirty years with admir- able dignity and grace. She moved freely amongst the people, drove in the Prater, the public park of Vienna, and showed herself continually at theatres, the opera, and open-air concerts. It was only the tragic death of her only son, in 1889, which shattered her health and crushed her lofty spirit, that caused her to withdraw from public life, forego all customary exercises, and retire into comparative seclusion, from which she emerged for the first time in 1896 for a few days, on the occasion of the visit paid to Vienna by the young Czar and Czarina of Russia. But even at the great banquet given in honour of the young Russian couple ^ Tlic culprit had to walk slowly through a double row of his comrades, and each struck his bare back with a stout birch rod : frequently he \\vent 011 till he fainted. It was a cruel practice, which \\vas abolished shortly alter Elizabeth had become Empress. ii is a 1 . ^ . - \' ■ I The Empress Elizabeth 57 she appeared in deep mourning, affording an espe- cially sad picture amidst the vivid colouring of her surroundings. During the seven years following her marriage, in the course of which two daughters and a son were born, the conjugal happiness of the Empress Elizabeth would have been complete but for the unpopularity which she incurred among the German subjects, and especially the Viennese, through her dislike to State ceremonials and Court entertainments, and her inveterate love of field sports and the exercises of the manege. From early morning to her dejeuner she spent her time at the imperial riding school, exercising horse after horse, and in the afternoon she could be seen daily in the Park riding on her private roads, generally using three or four horses in succession. So devoted was she to horse exercise that it was reported she learned to ride without a saddle, kneeling on horseback, and even standing, as we sometimes see done in a circus, for which reason she was nicknamed by the Viennese bourgeoisie "" The Circus Rider "" ; and her infrequent public appearances, despite the charm of her extra- ordinary beauty and grace, were coldly greeted by the populace of the imperial city. This, combined with the behaviour of the nobility at the time of her marriage, brought about a feeling of dislike for Vienna, whose people she considered narrow-minded, and not 5^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria unnaturally she was prompted to avoid the Austrian capital throughout nearly four decades of her august consort\'s reign, and to seek more congenial surround- ings in her Hungarian residence. Unfortunately in 1861 an incipient disease of the lungs compelled the young Empress to quit her country and sever herself for many months from her husband and children. She repaired to Madeira, where she remained for some months, and derived great benefit from its mild climate. In her habits she was always very simple and frugal, and it was no doubt on that account that even in her sixtieth year, and in spite of the many griefs which she had had to endure, she still looked much younger than she really was. Up to the end of her life she kept her graceful but almost too slender figure ; and her hair, which was always one of her chief glories, was still most abundant, though streaked with silver threads ; her fine complexion was unimpaired, and her wonderfully deep blue eyes were as expressive as of old. When at Ischl, for instance, she would go out sometimes at 5 a.m. Her walking costumes were very smart, and yet business-like ; she had a preference for short skirts in the style of a kilt reaching just above the ankles, and a short jacket over a waistcoat, which varied according to the seasons. As a rule she wore a soft felt hat with a blackcock\'s tail or a grouse\'5 foot, fastening a bunch The Empress Elizabeth 59 of her favourite Edelweiss as its only trimming ; and a good useful stick was always her companion. At no place, at home or abroad, did she entertain to any great extent. Now and then, however, a few guests would dine with her, when she always made herself most charming. Her dresses were ever in the best of taste. On one occasion, we read, she wore a white velvet dress made with a high Medici collar edged with white feathers, and a corsage cut square in front, while a deep edging of the feathers round the hem was the only trimming ; white suede gloves were on her arms, and her only ornament was, strange to say, a dagger, with the handle formed of very large diamonds, passed through her hair. Her dinners were simple, but excellent ; and the wines, of which there was a great profusion, were of the finest, although she herself only partook of a little claret. A great deal of formality was observed in the waiting, pages of different grades carefully drawing fine lines as to whom they served, those whose position permitted them to wait on the Empress of course ignoring all others. The Court of Austria is perhaps the most strict and severe as regards etiquette in Europe ; and how- ever much the Empress might have liked a quiet and retired life, and however much she might have attempted to bring about changes from the monotony 6o Elizabeth, Empress of Austria and strictness of the old Spanish etiquette which pre- vailed, she found it impossible to do away with a great deal of form which was almost mediaeval in its severity. In 1882, when illness prevented Her Majesty from indulging in riding exercise, she became a great pedestrian, and her excursions were sometimes both long and dangerous ; but the Emperor, although by no means a good walker, was exceptionally attentive to his imperial spouse, and always did his best to keep up with the Empress in her long walks, and never failed to accompany her during her excursions when staying with her. Very remarkable was the fearlessness and intrepidity of Her Majesty. At the opening of the Trieste Exhi- bition in the beginning of the eighties, an Italian irredentist ^ threw a bomb at the festive procession, several persons being wounded. The Emperor and Empress and Crown Prince intended a fortnight later going there ; but as danger was feared, a general desire was expressed for the Empress to remain away. "" If there is any danger of an attack,"" she replied to her husband, \'* I shall certainly go ; my place is then by your side."" And she went to Trieste. According to a confession made some time after- \' So were called tlie members of a party agitating for the severance of Trieste from Austria. They frequently employed violence as their means to an end, \'^\' The Empress Elizabeth 63 wards by the man Oberbank, it had been arranged to kill the imperial pair^with a couple of bombs at Trieste. Oberbknk was afterwards hanged with his associates. / To mention a predilection of the Jate Empress of Austria, it may be said that she was extremely fond of jewels, especially of emeralds and rubies, of which she had a marvellous collection. It was extraordinary how far her generosity reached, and it is well known that no official or servant, either high or low, who had any hand in contributing to the cordiality of the welcome or the convenience of the Empress in any country, failed to receive a recognition, personally when possible, and by deputy when not. In this country it will be remembered that, on the occasion of her visit to Liverpool, each individual official there and elsewhere throughout the railway system had the agreeable surprise of receiving a few days later a present of jewelry, together with a message of praise and thanks for the way in which they had fulfilled their duties. Each of these souvenirs, one of which was shown to me, must have cost a considerable sum of money. In the autumn of 1868 the Emperor and Empress, animated by the kindest feelings towards the Poles, reserved to visit Galicia ; but while suitable prepara- tions were being made for their cordial reception 64 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria political disturbances arose, and Count Beust insisted upon their Majesties postponing their visit, as it would endanger the Constitution, and consequently the visit was never carried out. The Empress regretted this very much, as she counted amongst her best friends some of the old Polish nobility. How difficult it must have been at first for the Empress to move in a sphere so antagonistic to her own ideas can easily be imagined. Whitman, in his Realm of the HabsburgSy speaks thus of Austrian society : ""Austrian society is very conservative ; even millionaires cannot enter it unless they have a pedigree."" An American Minister thirty years ago expressed himself in these words on the subject : "" If an Austrian should be a Shakespeare, Galileo, Nelson, and Raphael all in one, he could not be admitted into good society in Vienna unless he had the sixteen quarterings of nobility which birth alone could give him."" Austrian noblemen never let ancestral homes to strangers, and they never break their pledged word of honour. Neither the"" Emperor nor any of his family is ever set upon or hunted down and mobbed in the streets of the capital ; they can walk alone and unmolested anywhere. Only one signal failure can we record in the crusade Her Majesty undertook against the various ancient customs which she considered entirely out of date. As a Roman Catholic and a thinking and logical woman The Empress Elizabeth 65 she was strongly opposed to duelling, which is very prevalent, particularly in the army. On one occasion, when two young German noblemen of the Roman faith, who served in a Prussian cavalry regiment, and who had refused a challenge and expressed themselves as opposed on principle of religion to the practice, were obliged to quit the Army, they requested through their mother, who was a personal friend of Elizabeth, that she would prevail upon her husband to give them commissions in one of his hussar regiments. The Emperor, who never could resist an appeal from his consort, caused the Minister of War to make out commissions for the two young counts, but on the day on which they presented themselves at their new quarters the whole corps of officers belonging to the regiment to which the two were commissioned sent in their papers, not being willing to serve with men who had refused to comply with the unwritten code of honour observed in Austria. Naturally the War Minister could not spare gallant officers who had shown their prowess on the field of battle, and the commissions were withdrawn from the two opponents to duelling. It was said that Her Majesty felt her failure very strongly, but her tact was such that it would not allow her to go openly against public opinion. Nevertheless, she always considered duelling a grievous wrong, and S 66 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria often personally tried to interpose where her own acquaintances were concerned. When Elizabeth was able to entertain and partici- pate in Court functions, she was known as one of the most charming and afFable hostesses, trying her best to make every one feel at home, and herself dancing at and enjoying the balls and fetes. To give a typical picture of an Austrian Court ball, I may briefly describe one which took place only a year ago at the Hofburg in Vienna. The Emperor entered in Uhlan uniform, and was preceded by the Grand Chamberlain, Prince Rudolf Liechtenstein, walking backwards. The Emperor had on his arm the Duchess of Cumberland, magnificently dressed in white and yellow brocade, covered with silver filigree embroidery, and with bunches of violets scattered about the dress and train, which were edged with white marabout feathers. She wore on her head a coronet of leaves and roses, in diamonds. Her daughter, the Princess Marie Louise (who made her debut at the first State ball), was in pink tulle trimmed with garlands of roses, and wore some exquisite ropes of pink pearls as ornaments. The Archduchess Stephanie, who is considered one of the best-dressed women in Europe, had a lovely ball dress of dead white satin, covered with a trellis- work of silver and diamonds, and round the bodice - N * . V ». JLV *-\' ■-- 1. . , I ABTOR, L£NC HLD^N FOUND/ The Empress Elizabeth 69 was an edging of diamonds on white velvet, and a loosely tied bunch of pink and red roses. In her hair she wore a flat diadem of diamonds, and round her throat a collar of immense diamonds and a necklace of pigeon\'s-blood rubies. Her Imperial Highness was the most striking-looking woman in the room. The jewels of some of the wives of the great Hun- garian nobles were positively unsurpassable. Countess Esterhazy-Stockau wore a superb castellated crown of enormous diamonds in the mode of the Empire, and her neck and shoulders were literally a plastron of jewels ; Princess Montenuovo, the wife of the second Lord High Steward, wore wonderful emeralds ; and among the few English present was Lady Rumbold in black. The eflfect of the magnificent uniforms and marvellous jewels helped to make it an almost un- precedented sight. The commands for the ball were for half-past eight, supper was at eleven, and the whole aflTair was over by twelve o\'clock. As might be expected, there is an enormous amount of pomp accompanying such balls as the one just described ; but perhaps there is even more splendour displayed in religious ceremonies ; and the Empress, before her great bereavement in 1889, ^^^ foremost in setting the example of attending to religious duties and functions. The grandest spectacle is offered by the yearly procession of Corpus Christi, which wends 70 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria its way through some of the principal streets of Vienna. Thfe Empress, with the Emperor, followed the Host, which is carried by the Cardinal Archbishop, in jewelled mitre and cope, richly embroidered : the Archbishop walks solemnly under a canopy of purple and gold, and is assisted by a throng of bishops and priests : round them walk representatives of the noblest families of the realm, high officials, knights of the various orders in glittering uniforms, those of St. John and Malta in their long white mantles adorned with a cardinal Maltese cross ; Hungarian magnates, Polish princes and counts, in their picturesque national costumes of satin, velvet, and furs, covered with glittering gems of great value ; the Hungarian gardes du corps with their leopard-skin mantles, squadrons of cavalry and battalions of infantry. The Empress on such occasions used to be surrounded by all the Archduchesses, and her devotions were indeed sincere. Another religious ceremony in which she participated was the washing of the feet of twelve poor old women on Good Friday. This seems to be a very ancient ceremony. At the Austrian Court twelve old men and twelve old women from the work- house are selected, and dressed in the garb of ancient pilgrims, brought to the royal residence, where, in the midst of the greatest pomp, and in the presence of Ministers and Generals, proud Privy Councillors and The Empress Elizabeth ii Chamberlains, officers and pages, accompanied by the bodyguards, the Emperor and Empress with their own hands washed the feet of the respective twelve paupers. This is done to show their humility, as did a Teacher of ethics nineteen hundred years ago in Jerusalem. As a mother Her Majesty the Empress was always in her element. The birth of a son and two daughters during the first few years of their married life had made the imperial pair the happiest in Europe, so far as their domestic afFairs were concerned. During many years the Empress spent a large amount of her time either in the nursery of her beloved children or in places where poverty and misery could be alleviated. Her most joyful days were those which she spent with her children in solitude at some mountain castle or in some forest villa. She was generally present during the lesson time, and when unable to be so she never missed hearing a full report of the results of their day\'s teaching. She was particular, too, that the best understanding should exist between teacher and pupil, and although she was most strict in her demands of obedience she was never over-severe, and certainly never unjust ; she loved to see her children attach themselves with grateful affection to those who were placed over them, and this feeling was nurtured to such an extent that up to the last the greatest friend- ship existed between teacher and pupils. 71 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria As we have already remarked, besides her idolised only son, the late Empress had two daughters. The elder, the Arch- duchess Gisela, married, when she was seventeen, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, and has two sons and two daughters ; she com- memorated this year (1898) her silver wedding. The younger of Her Majesty\'s daughters, the Archduchess Marie Valerie, who THI ARCHDUCHE33 MARIE VALERIE, , , DAUGHTER Of THE EMPRESS. WaS DOm, tO the joy of the Hungarian people, at Godolo, on their soil, and educated by a Hungarian, Bishop Ronay, was married eight years ago to the Archduke Francis Salvator of Austria ; she has one daughter and four sons. The Empress of Austria, after her son\'s death, never saw much of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, who replaced him as heir to the throne, and who is at present unmarried. It was not from dislike to the The Empress Elizabeth 73 young man, who is handsome, tall, fair, and attractive, although unfortunately he possesses very indifferent health, but from a bereaved mother\'s very natural dis- taste to seeing any one in her son\'s place. When the young Archduke was threatened with consumption and his life was almost despaired of, the Empress visited him, and was much touched by his condition. During the early years of the Empress\'s married life occurred the disasters which de- prived Austria of her most treasured possessions ; they did not, however, after the first moment, disturb the conjugal felicity of the Em- peror and EJnpress, but no doubt it was these disasters which caused the Empress to abhor politics. Her husband was her hero, a knight of the days of the 74 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Crusades, and gladly would she have seen him lead his armies to battle in person ; she was persuaded that then the great reverses which had very frequently attended the Austrian arms could not have taken place. She was proud, as well she might be, of her young consort\'s splendid courage and his proficiency in all martial exercises, of his power of attaching men to his person, and of his great strategic ability ; and when the constitutional era arrived she was wounded deeply to feel that he must sink his brilliant per- sonality, and merely play the part of an ordinary constitutional sovereign — to be an autocrat had been her ideal. Her chagrin and grief found a willing echo in the Emperor\'s own heart, and there was danger for a time that their private life would be shadowed by these public disasters. Elizabeth, who, with all her eccentricity and singu- larity, was possessed of very great common sense, had foreseen this contingency and prepared for it. She had resolved that her role should be to make her husband, from the moment he entered her presence, forget the cares and trials of his exalted position, and occupy his mind with a fresh series of ideas, that would not only afFord him relaxation, but send him back reinvigorated to his labours, for the advantage of all concerned ; and it was in consequence of his wife\'s love and wise actions that the Emperor has been able to The Empress Elizabeth 75 preserve the vigour and energy of youth, although for half a century he has been one of the most hard-working men in Europe. In 1879 the Empress celebrated her silver wedding. Fetes were given in Vienna and Buda-Pesth, Her Majesty staying part of the week at the former and part at the latter place. The historical pageant, arranged by the great painter Hans Makart, has become renowned for its magnificence and picturesqueness. The principal event took place on Thursday, the 24th of April, in the new votive Church of St. Saviour, the consecration of which was also performed. This, perhaps the most beautiful modern Gothic structure in Europe, was built by public subscription in memory of the escape of the Emperor from death by the assassin\'s knife, and was opened for public services on that day. The open-air festivities were marred by the weather, for the day was very wet, and the grand allegorical procession had to be postponed. The then Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Count Andrassy, gave a most brilliant soiree at the Foreign Office. The procession of carriages conveying the guests took two hours to pass : the Emperor himself arrived at half-past ten, and stopped an hour. After the close of the festivities, in which the Empress took the greatest interest, the imperial couple, accom- panied by the Archduchess Gisela and Prince Ludwig 7 6 Elizabeth, Empress o( Austria of Bavaria, the Empress\'s brother, arrived at Buda-Pesth, and spent a week there during the races. It had been intimated that no official reception was desired — indeed, the day and hour of arrival only became known at noon ; yet, moved by one impulse, the populace went out to welcome their King and Queen with a warmth and enthusiasm such as even here have rarely been witnessed. The last rejoicing in which Her Majesty displayed any great interest was on the occasion of the marriage of the Crown Prince Rudolf. The way in which the royal betrothal was brought about at Brussels is so very out of the ordinary, and shows so well the liberal teaching of the Prince\'s mother, that I will give it in detail. The Archduke Rudolf proposed in person to Princess Stephanie of Belgium at an evening party given in his honour at the Chateau de Laeken. Among the amusements provided for their Majesties\' guests was a concert in the magnificent conservatory attached to the palace. Matters had been so arranged, that, when the company were conducted from the salon to the winter garden, the Archduke and the Princess were left together tete-a-tete for a few minutes. As soon as they were alone the Crown Prince approached Her Royal Highness with a low and formal obeisance, saying, "" Madam, will you take me for a husband .^ "" To which plain question the Princess simply replied, The Empress Elizabeth 77 curtseying deeply, "" Yes, Your Imperial Highness."" *\' Your Royal Highness\'s answer makes me supremely happy,"" observed the Archduke. *\'And I,"" rejoined Princess Stephanie, ""promise that I will do my duty towards you under all circumstances."" No more was said ; but the youthful pair, arm in arm, joined the royal circle in the winter garden ; and the Archduke, leading his fair companion up to her father, addressed King Leopold as follows: ""Sire, I have, with Your Majesty\'s permission, begged Princess Stephanie to bestow her hand upon me. It is my happy privilege to inform you that my petition has been granted."" "" I rejoice, Monseigneur,"" replied the King, "" to greet you as my son-in-law."" The Princess embraced her mother, and immediately afterwards the betrothal was announced to the assembled public. The Empress had already in former years suffered from painful ischialgia, which made her sojourn in the South, and especially on the lake side, imperative. Her diet was most frugal, and consisted principally of milk and fruit ; but unfortunately under this treat- ment she became anaemic, and was therefore obliged, upon the advice of the doctors, to change her regimen for a stronger one. During the last month of her life the state of Her Majesty\'s health became greatly improved ; she no longer suffered from insomnia, had more appetite. 78 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria and became visibly stronger. Before going to Switzer- land she spent some months at Nauheim in the Duchy of Hesse, where she had been examined by means of the Rontgen rays, and Dr. Schott, her physician, expressed a confident expectation that Her Majesty\'s stay would prove beneficial. This antici- pation was realised, and the improvement made was so marked that she was about to return to Vienna to participate in the fetes which were to take place in connection with her husband\'s Jubilee. The Grand Duke of Hesse, who, with the Grand Duchess, had visited Her Majesty more than once at her villa at Nauheim, pleased with the success of her medical attendant. Dr. Schott, conferred upon him the title of Professor. Elizabeth had here also received a visit from the Empress Frederick and the German Emperor and his spouse. I need hardly say that the feelings which pre- vailed in Vienna during the first years of the married life of the Empress underwent a thorough change, and from the year i860 she became the beloved and popular mistress of the realm. Deep was the sympathy shown to her in the terrible trials which she underwent during her life. A mayor of Vienna, old Dr. Zelinka, once said to the citizens, ""No other lady is like our Empress,"" and he fully ex- pressed the feeling of the Viennese ; she was unique. [thf A8TOR, LtNOX *NU TiLDiLN FOUNO/TIONS. The Empress Elizabeth Si the noblest, the sweetest, and the kindest woman in the Empire. I cannot end the present chapter in a more appro- priate manner than by giving a short description of some of the palaces in which the Empress principally dwelt when in Austria, and where she entertained or assisted her husband in State functions. In a future chapter I shall speak of those palaces which she had built herself, and which were her personal property, and where, especially since 1889, she spent the greater part of her life. In Vienna she occupied that wing of the imperial resi- dence (the Hofburg, a conglomeration of buildings of enormous extent and varied styles) which is called the Bellaria, and which is the most modern part ; her rooms were distinguished by their exquisite tastefulness, and entire absence of all ostentation. For many years she selected Schonbrunn, the suburban residence of the Emperor, for her headquarters. This castle, with its very fine gardens and park, its charming summer pavilion, its lakes and its fountains, is an extremely comfortable house, in spite of its enormous dimensions ; it is deservedly called the Austrian Versailles ; and an idea of its size will be formed when I mention that it contains one thousand four hundred and forty-one rooms and one hundred and thirty-nine kitchens. From 1805 to 1809 this beautiful and ancient seat 6 82 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria of the Habsburgs was inhabited temporarily by Napoleon I. ; and his son, the Duke of Reichstadt, King of Rome, died there in 1832. The gardens are adorned with marble statues by Bayer, representing gods and goddesses of the Greek mythology ; and one of the most exquisite works of art is the fountain of Neptune — a fine group of marble statuary by Bayer, Von Hasenauer, and Zacherl ; they are most pictur- esquely posed upon granite rock, and form the base of the fountain, two large and many small water jets being thrown up to various heights. Not far from Vienna there is another extremely picturesque castle, at present occupied by the Crown Prince\'s widow, named Laxenburg, which was in former years often the home of the murdered Empress, and where the three elder children were born. The park is very extensive and beautiful, containing some charming ornamental waters, and an old ivy-covered feudal castle, the Franzensburg. The lovely marine residence of the late Emperor of Mexico has also frequently sheltered the Empress Elizabeth. It is one of the finest palaces belonging to the Habsburgs, and is situated on the Adriatic, near Trieste. The gardens, with their semi-tropical vegeta- tion, defy description, the ever blue sky and sea lending a special charm to this lovely spot. Another of the favourite residences was the imperial s> » \' - ■» .1 . J ."" >■ The Empress Elizabeth 85 villa at Ischl, in the province of Salzburg. It lies in a valley encompassed by high mountains, and is surrounded by most picturesque scenery. The imperial couple were accustomed to spend some months annually at that well-favoured spot, and it may be that their love for it was partly due to the fact that it was here that the Emperor and Empress met for the first time. CHAPTER III. THE QUEEN OF HUNGARY. 87 CHAPTER III. THE QUEEN OF HUNGARY. IT was soon after her marriage that Elizabeth accom- panied the Emperor to Hungary. The revolution of 1848 and 1849, which had been crushed with such terrible severjty, and the most disastrous con- sequences to the Hungarian people, had fostered a feeling akin to hatred against the young Emperor- King. It was therefore the more remarkable that Her Majesty succeeded so rapidly in winning the hearts of the Magyars. "" Veni^ vidi^ vici "" — this was the experience of the monarch\'s beautiful bride. The Hungarians are essentially chivalrous and senti- mental ; their high sense of nobility, their veneration for womanhood, and their extraordinary love of beauty caused them to forget past grievances and wrongs, and to ofFer their hearts and souls to the lovely, afFable, and sympathetic woman, who, at least by name, was their Queen, and who had come to them with such confidence and love. Who has not heard of the historical scene at th^ 99 90 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria palace at Buda-Pesth more than a hundred years ago, when their then Queen, the great Empress Marie Theresa, threw herself upon their honour and mercy, when hard pressed by Prussia and other enemies, and abandoned by her allies ? With the baby King, Joseph II., in her arms, she made her hysterical appeal to the barbaric but chivalrous magnates of Trans- Leithania. "" Moriamur pro r agin t t nostra ! "" was the cry that resounded through the palace. How willingly the Magyars of to-day would have repeated these memorable words ! There is not the slightest doubt that it was due in a very great measure to the love the Hungarian people bore for Elizabeth that Beust succeeded in 1867 in cementing the union between the two powerful factions of the Empire, and the Hungarians always preserved a grateful remembrance, bordering on ecstasy, of the part the Empress played at the time of the completion of the union with Home Rule (Ausgleich). Elizabeth showed throughout her lite a great predilection for the Hungarian people — no doubt on account, in some degree, of their characteristic seriousness and love for nature : even their songs and music are permeated by a mystic melancholy which brought them into close touch with Her Majesty\'s own feelings. At the Coronation, which took place in Buda-Pesth in 1867, the enthusiasm for their Queen broke out The Queen of Hungafy 93 in the most extraordinary ovations : all hearts seemed to go out towards her. She understood them so well ; and having early in her married life mastered their language, one of the most difficult in Europe, she was able to converse freely with them in their own tongue. When the Emperor had given his consent, in accordance with the desire of the Magyars, to be crowned with the ancient crown of St. Stephen, a deputation of the Hungarian nation appeared also before the Empress in Vienna, begging her that she too would allow herself to be crowned as the Hungarian Queen. Her answer, which I give in full, was characteristic of her, and gave the greatest satisfaction to the members of the deputation : — *\' With the greatest happiness I fulfil the wish or the nation which you have laid before me, and which coincides entirely with my own most warm desire, and I bless the Providence that has preserved my life for this great moment. Please convey to your people my most sincere thanks and my most heartfelt greeting."" The part Her Majesty played during the various ceremonies and festivities at the royal palace in Buda-Pesth was such that I feel this work would not be complete without at least giving a full description of the Coronation. The pomp and enthusiasm it is 94 Eliitabeth, Empress of Austria difficult to describe ; but this much can be said — the centre of all this ecstasy was the youthful Princess, endowed with radiant beauty, whose happy countenance and sweet smiles seemed to throw a sunny light upon all those who had the privilege of gazing upon her. I cannot do better than give the report of the Coronation as it appeared in the Illustrated London News of June 1867 : — "" Francis Joseph I., Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, succeeded to the sovereignty both of the Empire and of the Kingdom nearly twenty years ago ; but the Magyars of Hungary, who struggled in 1 849 to free their country from its connection with Austria, when they were crushed by the intervention of Russia, have but lately consented to acknowledge him as their King upon a concession of due guarantees for their constitutional liberties. The ceremonies of his Coronation, which took place on the 8th inst. [June 1 867] at Buda and Pesth, the twin cities of the Danube forming the capital of Hungary, were extremely splendid. "" The Emperor and Empress, with their relatives the Archdukes, were lodged in the Castle of Buda, on the height above the suspension bridge connecting Buda and Pesth. Here the Emperor, or rather King, as he is called in Hungary, had received deputations from the House of Magnates and the House of The Queen of Hungary 95 Deputies, with their addresses of loyalty, two days before. At seven in the morning a procession of courtiers, officers of State, noblemen, magnates, and knights, with Count Andrassy, the Prime Minister, escorted His Majesty on horseback, the Empress in a carriage, and the Archdukes, from the royal palace to the Parish Church of Buda, where they were met by the Primate of Hungary, the Archbishop of Gran, with other prelates and clergy, "" Having knelt to receive the crucifix and holy water, their Majesties were led into the chapel, the trumpets and kettledrums sounding. Here the Crown jewels were placed in the hands of the barons of the realm, and in the procession which then moved towards the high altar the crown of St. Stephen was borne by Count Andrassy, as representative of the Palatine. The Ban of Croatia, Baron Sokcevic, carried the globe ; and the Judex Curiae, M. Majlath, the sceptre ; the Tavernicus, Baron Sennyey, the pyx ; the Royal Hungarian Cupbearer, the sword of State ; and the Royal Hungarian Lord High Chancellor, the cross. "" The Crown jewels were placed on the high altar, and the Archbishop of Kalocsa commenced the service with the formula of the Church according to the Pontificale Romanum. After several responses in Latin, the Emperor was led to the altar, and, kneeling, took the Coronation Oath. His Majesty then descended to 9 6 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria the lowest step before the altar, and lay prostrate at full length on his face during the reading of the Litany, at the conclusion of which His Majesty was conducted behind the altar, where he laid aside his pelisse, kalpak, and sabre, and prepared for the unction. \'\' Next His Majesty was anointed with holy oil by the Primate. This part of the ceremony excited much interest. As the Primate poured the oil on His Majesty\'s right arm and between the shoulders he prayed reverently ; and when the ceremony was over, the King, rising, went behind the altar (where the superfluous unction was dried), and reappeared after a time, and walked to the foot of the throne, where he knelt down and seemed to pray. While he was thus kneeling, the Lord High Chamberlain and Marshal of the Court and officiating prelates approached with the royal mantle of St. Stephen, and placed it solemnly over his shoulders. This is clearly proved to have been a casula, the work of Gisela, Queen of St. Stephen, made in a.d. 1031, and is regarded with the utmost veneration by all Hungarians. It was a gift to the Church originally, and has undergone some mutilation. When it is out of repair, it must be mended by no other hands than those of the Queen herself. ""The High Mass now began, to the blare of trumpets and the roll of kettledrums. The King, surrounded by i The Queen of Hungary 97 his officers of high state, was led to the altar, where he knelt and bowed his head to the Primate, who placed the naked sword of St. Stephen in his hand with the words of the formula. The Primate then received back the sword from the Emperor, put it into the sheath, and fastened the belt round his loins. The King now stood erect, and, turning his face to the people, drew the ancient blade, and with vigorous hand made the steel flash in the light, as he cut first in front, then to the right, and then to the left, THE E-IPREISSOOS AFTER accordmg to tradi- tion, and returned the sword to its sheath, while the artillery thundered out a salvo from outside the church. \'* After brandishing the sword of St. Stephen, the King once more knelt on the highest step of the altar ; and there the Archbishop of Gran, as Prince Primate, and Count Andrassy, representing the Pala- tine, put the crown of St, Stephen on his head. The 7 9 8 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Primate, with his hands on the crown, gave the blessing, and presented His Majesty first with the sceptre in his right and the globe in his left hand. Having done this, the Primate removed the sword of St. Stephen from the King\'s side, and returned it to the Royal Hungarian Cupbearer ; and when that was done the second salvo was fired. The King, surrounded by eleven magnates, was now solemnly con- ducted to the throne, and took his place on it with much solemnity. The Primate, standing on his right, pronounced the words, \' Sta et retina a modo locum quam hue usque paterna successione tenuisti hareditani jure tibi a Deo delegatum per auctoritatem omnipotentis Dei.\' Count Andrassy made a sign, and at once the whole assembly burst into an * Eljen,\' which was repeated three times with thrilling efl^ect. The cannon thundered from the Blocksberg ; the bells of Buda and Pesth burst into chimes. "" The King was crowned. As crowned he presented his consort to the Primate, and demanded that she might be crowned ; and another service commenced, the crown and insignia being laid on the altar. The service for the Queen was similar to that of the King ; a crown was put on her head, but the royal crown was only held on her right shoulder for a time, after which it was replaced on the head of the King. At one time the King and Queen lay prostrate on their faces, The Queen of Hungary 99 as His Majesty had done. After the ceremonies were completed, the King and Queen went in procession through the church gates to the garrison church, where all the royal insignia, except the crown, were laid aside, while the King made a number of knights, dubbing them with the sword of St. Stephen. "" The procession, on marching from the church to go from Buda across the river to Pesth, was formed very much as it started ; but it was swollen by the banderia of the counties, by the bishops and prelates and mitred abbots, who formed a very fine-looking body of cavalry; and by the bearers of insignia, who took their places on splendid horses. The magnates and noblemen were also mounted, but attended by their footmen and hussars a pied in the most costly and curious liveries. "" After a time a break was made in the procession by the appearance of some Court footman, and a singular horseman in an old faded greenish mantle, with a helmet-shaped cap of metal on his head. This was the King whom they had crowned. He rode a tall and powerful cream-coloured charger, which was restive enough to show his rider\'s powers to great advantage, and as he passed enthusiastic cheers greeted the monarch from the crowds of his people, rolling like a flood as he went. The pro- cession wound round by the quays and streets till 107312 loo Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria His Majesty came to the square in front of the Parish Church of Buda ; here a tribune was erected, three feet high, covered with cloth of gold, at the foot of the monumental column in honour of the Virgin Mary. This was the tribune on which the King took his stand ; and there in the presence of the people, raising three fingers of the right hand to heaven and holding aloft a crucifix in his left, with his face to the east, he took the oath amidst three tremendous * Eljens,\' and salvos and volleys of musketry. \'* The procession then returned from the church to the Franz Josef Platz, where an artificial mound had been raised for the last scene of the Coronation Ceremony. At half-past eleven the King of Hungary rode up to the summit of the hill alone. His appear- ance was hailed with tremendous cheers. He raised the sword and cut towards the east ; then he turned towards the west, and cut in that direction again ; he wheeled his horse towards the south, and cut again ; and the sword cross was completed when he made his sword gleam towards the north. This per- formance made a very effective scene. "" The King then rode down, and the mob rushed in, and in an instant the square was filled with people shouting \' Eljen \' till the welkin rang. "" Baron, afterwards Count Beust, the Prime Minister of Austria, came in for a share of the applause. The Queen of Hungary loi ""Oh the return to the palace there was a State banquet, to allow the Court functionaries to per- form their duties, while the magnates waited at table. The people were revel- ling in the meadow close at hand, where six hogsheads of wine and three whole oxen roasted were provided for all comers."" What a noble the emperor at about thirtv-five. deed of the royal couple to hand over the Coronation gift of 100,000 ducats for the foundation of a fund for the assistance of widows and orphans of the very soldiers who in 1849 had fought for their liberty against the Emperor Francis Joseph ! What a complete reconciliation when we see the foremost person at the Coronation to be Count Julius Andrassy, who had been condemned to death as a traitor in 1849, and had only escaped with his life by precipitate flight from his country ! * t 1 02 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria It was on the occasion of the Coronation that the Hungarian nation presented their Queen with the Castle of Godolo, situated in charming scenery not far from the capital. It has been frequently maintained by those who are in a position to know best that Elizabeth spent her happiest days at Godolo : here all pomp and show was dispensed with ; here she kept her hunting stud and kennels ; here she was entirely her own mistress, unrestrained by Court ceremony, surrounded by her favourite ladies-in-waiting, equerries, and servants ; and here she indulged in the life she loved best. The Magyars simply adored and wor- shipped her. It is certain that she fully returned their affection with a heartiness the sincerity of which was never doubted in the Kingdom of the Five Rivers. She shared their field sports, to which she imparted a prestige and an impulse of unprecedented force ; her knowledge of their national history and literature was complete ; and she won the love of all, high and low, and the admiration and appreciation of such renowned scientists as Ferencz Pulsky and Vambery. She counted amongst her most intimate friends many Hungarians, of whom I will only mention Count Julius Andrassy, Abbe Liszt, Count Maylath, and Tis)^a. The great novelist Moritz Jokai called her his "" ideal of a noble woman."" Deak, the greatest of Hungarian patriots of the JTHF..- I. . I N\' «/. Ort. L\' •^O\'* » - j: r • • f- r;. . , The Queen of Hungary 105 century, pronounced her "" the noblest Hungarian of them all "" ; and, having refused titles and money as the reward of his services to his country, accepted, instead of honours and wealth, a simple pair of slippers, worked for him by the loving hands of the Queen of Hungary. Before he died she visited him on his sick-bed at the hotel ""Queen of England,"" and after his death she watched and prayed by his coffin, and manifested her sincere grief by the tears she shed as she knelt at the foot of his justly venerated bier. On this occasion she showed her wonted tact, when, being informed that the recovery of Hungary\'s Hampden had become very doubtful, she sent one of her equerries to his hotel to ask if she might be allowed to come and visit him ; and when he had closed his eyes for the everlasting rest, and as the body lay in the hall of the Royal Academy, which was transformed into a chapel of mourning, a simple Court carriage arrived at the door, and the Empress, dressed in deep niourning, entered. She held in her hand a wreath of laurels, with beautiful camellias and white satin ribbons, inscribed with the words : *\' Erzsebet Kiralyne Deak Ferencznek "" ("" Queen Eliza- beth to Frantz Deak ""). A few minutes she stood in contemplation before the coffin, tears rolling down her cheeks ; then she placed the wreath upon the bier, io6 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria and knelt down and prayed. This scene has been immortalised by two of Hungary\'s greatest painters-^ Munkacsy and Michael Ziczy. The only time during the Empress\'s life that she evinced any interest in politics was when she assisted - 1873. in the reconciliation of the Austrian and Hungarian Governments. It was the absence of Her Majesty — who, over- whelmed by so many disasters, could not be prevailed upon to participate in the festivities of the one- thousanth year of Hungarian independence (celebrated in 1 896) — which threw a shadow over the large The Queen of Hungary 107 assembly of Hungarian patriots. In spite of the enthusiasm and the great pomp which were displayed at the various ceremonies of the time, the absence of the Queen who was so much loved prevented the occasion from being the success which it would other- wise have been. In what esteem, ay, reverence, the Hungarians held their Queen was well expressed by the passing of a Bill in the Houses of Parliament, soon after she had lost her life, for perpetuating her name by inserting a record of her life in the archives of the nation and erecting a monument to her memory in the Hungarian capital by voluntary subscriptions. CHAPTER IV. THE EMPRESS AS A WOMAN, PHILANTHROPIST, FRIEND, AND MISTRESS. 109 CHAPTER IV. THE EMPRESS AS A WOMAN, PHILANTHROPIST, FRIEND, AND MISTRESS, THE influence which the Empress brought to bear upon the vexed question of woman\'s rights is of great importance, even if we accept the opinions of some who maintain that she was not in favour of inducing women to take too large an interest in politics. But she has doubtless con- tributed much to the accomplishment of the un- deniable fact that womankind has made remarkable progress in the realm during the long reign of her husband, who, as is well known, ever consulted her when questions arose or needed decision in which the fate of women was concerned. The changes in the position of women which took place during the forty- four years in which the Empress shared the throne of Francis Joseph are enormous, especially in the higher circles and the middle classes. It was ever one of Her Majesty\'s endeavours to III 112 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria alleviate also the position of the working women, which unfortunately is still such as to need urgent reform. It was upon her initiative that an inquiry was recently made into the conditions under which working women live in Austria, and especially in Vienna. The disclosures resulting therefrom caused Her Majesty the deepest grief, and in a letter written to a noble- man who might well be called the Austrian Shaftesbury she begged him to do all in his power to see that a change was speedily made, assuring him at the same time of her most hearty co-operation. The inquiry was conducted during the spring of 1896 by the Society of Ethical Culture. The state of affairs brought to light was most lamentable ; and the Empress, shortly before her death, made the strongest representations to the Home Secretary, in order to induce him to see that the terrible misery existing among the lowest class of women and girls should be changed. "" My heart bleeds,"" she wrote, ""when I think of the misery of those poor women and girls, who work like slaves of ancient times, without even being able to earn enough to feed themselves properly. The vessel entrusted by God with the propagation and continuation of mankind should at least be above want — the gratitude of us all demands so much."" We give a few items from the report referred to. The Empress as a Woman 1 1 3 in order to show how justified the Empress was in expressing her indignation in the strongest words : — "" In box-making the apprentices are compelled to work during many months at wages of one florin 114 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria (is. id.) a week. . . . The confectioner\'s trade shows a great mortality from lung disease, caused by the sugar dust, which is also very injurious to the eyes ; the women must often work at a temperature of 148° Fahrenheit. The average age attained by the work-people is thirty-two years. In the flower and feather industries hundreds of young girls are kept in a kind of domestic slavery, and are forced to work sixteen, eighteen, even twenty hours a day for their board, lodging, and a few pence per week. They are miserably fed and packed two or three in one bed, a single room often containing three or four such beds. ""Apprentices usually work three years without any payment. At carnival times the girls sometimes work the whole night ; and during several months the time allowed them for sleep is very short. A similar system is found in the glove and bandage trades ; the workers — mostly young girls hired from the country districts — are exhausted by overwork, ill lodged, ill fed, and still worse paid. In the em- broidery trade there is intense competition, partly caused by the home work of women of the lower middle class. Gold and silk embroidery — very trying to the eyes, especially at night — is largely done by quite young girls, kept as apprentices many years, and paid about two florins a week ; a very highly The Empress as a Woman 115 » skilled work-woman earns about fifty to sixty kreutzers (lid. to IS.) 2L day. Liver and lung diseases are very common in this industry. "" The hardest labour performed by women is in brick-making and house-building ; in the latter they are obliged to draw carts containing great loads of mortar, to carry heavy mortar buckets up the scaffolds, and to endure cold and heat during a working day of sixteen or seventeen hours, labouring away, true martyrs, up to a motherhood that brings them no joy and allows them no rest. . . . Besides the trades mentioned, the condition of milliners, washerwomen, shop-girls, and so forth has been investigated ; but the examples given will be sufficient to show the want and misery endured by female workers in Austria. ... A great number of the women die prematurely, and but a small percentage are able to bear and rear healthy children."" It is to be hoped that for the sake of the sacred memory of the Empress Elizabeth, whose sympathy was so warmly engaged in this matter, steps will be taken without delay to alleviate the fate of these poor innocent creatures. Anyhow, the first step has been taken, for the classes knew that they had a strong protectress in the wife of their sovereign, and her teaching has caused in women an awakening to their true calling, and through this the incipient emancipation ii6 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria from their former thraldom. I am able to pay a reverential tribute to the exalted lady for the noble work she has done in this regard, by setting an example which has exerted the greatest influence throughout the land. It was that most beneficent lady, the youth- ful Empress Elizabeth, who, shortly after she had taken her place as mistress of the feudal Court in Vienna, broke the fetters which old custom and usage had placed on the gentle sex, the highest and the lowest, and by her example gave an impetus to the agita- tion which produced the comparatively healthy state of afl^airs which now exists, at all events in the upper and middle classes. Without following even partly the movement and its development, I intend to give some instances of what must have been the outcome of this long and beneficent work, and we cannot but rejoice, not only at the bright examples of the women and their Empress in Austria, but also to find that they were fully appre- ciated by all classes of the Empire. Their influence upon the social state, and not infrequently even upon politics, has been incalculable, for they have taken the lead in many social movements, and by their perse- verance, patience, and tact have carried to a successful issue many important plans. The beginning of the festivities in connection with the Jubilee, which received such a terrible check, The Empress as a Woman 1 1 7 took place towards the end of June at Vienna. A great procession and pageant of marksmen and huntsmen, consist- ing of more than twenty thousand men from all parts of the Empire, with contingents from Bavaria and other German states, moved through the principal streets of the capital ; and one could not help ^""^ archduke fhedebick. being strongly impressed by a particular feature in the procession — namely, the prominent and honoured position given to womankind in a pageant which fifty years ago would certainly have been considered essentially a masculine one. There marched among the marksmen a goodly troop of markswomcn, who had won many victories in former shooting matches, and who were enthusiastically cheered by the enormous crowds of sightseers as they passed ii8 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria in their neat uniforms, carrying their rifles on their shoulders. Here could be clearly traced the influence of the Empress-Queen, who had herself devoted much time to athletic exercises and to sports of all kinds that assisted physical develop- ment ; for she was throughout her life a warm advocate of outdoor pastimes and of healthful recreation. Among the various waggons which adorned the marksmen\'s procession, and upon which groups were arranged, one of the finest was the one representing \'* Austria."" On a throne tastefully draped with silks and satins in the Austrian colours, a sword of state in her right hand, and the left resting on a shield of gold emblazoned with the arms of the Empire, sat a youthful dame of great beauty and dignity. A second waggon carried a bust of the venerable Emperor, surrounded by "" Vindobona "" (emblematic of Vienna), the Muse of History, the Genius of Peace, and the Goddess of War, all represented by Viennese ladies, guarded by officers of the Viennese Volunteers in the uniform of 1809 to 1866. But especially picturesque was the cortege of this festal waggon, which consisted of about sixty ladies in the costume of Old Vienna, accompanied in some cases by their swains. The fact that this part of the procession was the most popular, wa§ cheered more than any The Empress as a Woman 1 1 9 other, is a proof ^ that the women of the Empire and their work are duly appreciated. That woman\'s political and social position has so much altered, and that there are to- day the highest schools of learning equally open to both sexes, is no doubt due to the fact that their capabilities have become so evident that any further attempt to suppress them must have proved abortive, and that they not only engage the sympathy of all thinking men, but also the esteem and admiration of the great majority who have hitherto blindly denied even the intellectual equaUty of women with men. But I must not overlook the teaching of the highest lady in the land, and it is not too much to say that the I20 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria late Empress introduced into Austria a perfectly new regime. She was brought up by her parents in simplicity, but with liberal ideas ; she was allowed to mix freely with the masses, and in this wise to become acquainted with all conditions of men and women ; and the lessons of her girlhood\'s days were not forgotten when she was called upon to share the throne of a powerful potentate. She was for her time certainly an \'^ advanced "" woman. Her influence upon the Viennese Court was quite extraordinary, and soon the female element became as much a part of the realm to be taken into considera- tion as the male one. The Emperor, whose love for her was so true and sincere, was happy to assist her in this work ; but whether she converted him to her ideas, or whether he had emancipated himself on his own initiative from the old narrow way of the imperial family, it would be difficult to state. The fact remains that in honouring people the Emperor made no difl^erence on account of sex, and there was at least one high order long existing in Austria which was bestowed on ladies only. Be it granted that the Sternkreutz Order was only given to noble dames ; but it was an order of knighthood, and its very existence proved that women\'s equality with men was recognised at the Court, even at a time when it otherwise deserved to be called the mo^t narrow-minded in Europe. The Empress as a Woman 121 The part taken in politics durii^ the era of Napoleon III. by the wife of the then Austrian Ambassador in Paris, Princess Paulina Metternich, has be- come historical, and similar important positions were held by the Countess Taafe and many others. Princess Metternich must be remembered amongst the remark- able women of the century ; she is at present engaged in writing her memoirs, which are sure to contain many most interesting incidents of the last eleven years of the Second Empire. Her friendship with the Empress Elizabeth was very intimate, and it appeared that the two ladies had many objects in common. Prince Richard presented his credentials as ambassador 122 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria to Napoleon III. in December 1859 ; be was then only tbirty-one years old, and the Princess twenty-four — the very prime of life for both ; she was the daughter of a great Hungarian nobleman, the late Count Sandor, one of the most renowned sportsmen and horsemen in that country, and of whose wonderful feats, achieve- ments, and foolhardy undertakings on horseback Hungary is even now full. Soon after the Princess had established herself in the French capital she became a persona gratissima in the Tuileries ; her accomplish- ments were many, her influence great, and as a conversationalist she had no rival ; she wielded an enormous power, and history some future day will tell what beneficent use she made of it. It was she who introduced Wagner\'s music into Paris. Tannhduser was received absolutely with derision. ""And now,"" the Princess said a short time ago to an ambassador in Vienna, \'\' the Parisians are more Wagnerian than I am myself."" With the fall of Napoleon, Prince and Princess Met- ternich returned to Vienna, and the Princess\'s influence upon society was soon felt there. After the death of her husband in 1895 she retired almost entirely from Court life, but re-entered it this year (1898), and her first reappearance was at a most charming charity feie held in the Belvedere Gardens in Vienna, under the patronage of Her Majesty and the Archduchesses. The Empress, The Empress as a Woman 123 although absent, took the warmest interest in the phil- anthropic undertaking. It was an al-fresco arrange- ment, and tents of various colours, ten of each shade, ran down the centre avenue ; the articles sold in each tent were of the same colour, and the dresses of the ladies matched. Princess Metternich herself presided at one of the violet tents, and was in lilac silk trimmed with old point de Venice ; Countess Beckers wore violet and white checked silk, and a bonnet trimmed with purple and white hyacinths ; Princess Monte- nuovo had a blue stall, and wore the akchi corn-flower muslin trimmed with quantities of Valenciennes lace ; Countess Wydenbruck, who had as assistant Miss Clemens (Mark Twain\'s daughter), was in green silk, and wore a hat with wild roses. The rose-coloured tents had keepers in all shades of pink and crimson, Princess 124 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Schwartzenberg being in deep pink and wearing a toque of carnations. All these ladies had been honoured by the late Empress\'s friendship. There was a novelty in the shape of a market-place, where noble ladies sat under huge mushroom umbrellas of different gay colours, and sold country produce, which included splendid grapes, fine peaches, and juicy nectarines. I have described this fair more in detail because it must stand as a type for many similar fites^ and because I wish to show as an undisputed fact that ladies under the leadership of Elizabeth or her deputy raised almost all the funds for. the extensive charitable work in Austria. Their indefatigable energies and their resources seem to come to no end. As hostesses Viennese ladies rank very high. It was the cause of the greatest regret when the late Empress entirely retired from Court life after the death of her much-beloved son the Crown Prince ; but the spirit which she had introduced still remained, and her place was most fitly filled by either the Archduchess Marie Theresa (before she became a widow) or the Arch- duchess Otto, the Crown Prince\'s widow rarely caring to be conspicuous at Court festivities. However, the great hostess of to-day is the Archduchess Isabel, the wife of the Archduke Frederick, who is the possessor of immense wealth and of a splendid palace well situated for entertainments upon a large scale. Her The Empress as a Woman 125 balls, next tn the Court balls, are the most brilliant and exclusive, only imperial and royal personages, the members of the highest aristocracy, diplomats, and those holding high positions in the military and civil services having the entree to them. Princess Isabel is the mother of seven daughters, and one son (born quite recently), and is much liked in society ; her husband is an able and popular soldier ; and it may be said that the Empress always showed a very great hking for this imfierial couple. I may mention here also that there is not a more popular lady in Viennese society than the wife of the British Ambassador, and the balls 126 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria at the Embassy are counted among the best during the season ; they were some of the few which in former days were honoured by Her Majesty\'s presence. It would be quite impossible to give even an approximate list of the ladies of the gay world, of the hauie finance^ etc., who are of renown as hostesses in that city, and as difficult would it be to describe the wholesome change which has taken place during the last forty years in the entertainments themselves. The formerly strictly observed ceremonial and etiquette have given place to a nonchalance and freedom introduced at Court by the Empress when a bride, which make the fetes of to-day really affairs of pleasure. Like our own country, Austria has, during the two or three last decades, produced some women renowned as novelists, poetesses, and actresses, who have been highly honoured and appreciated, and whose social position has become equal to any : we will name from the many only Madame Wolter, who married Count O\'Sullivan, and Fraulein von Hohenfels, both of whom could boast not only of the esteem but also of the friendship of their imperial mistress. Many women have attained to a high degree in art, both in paint- ing and in sculpture, and have been distinguished by the Emperor. If we look into the lower spheres of society, we cannot help finding also here an evident change for The Empress as a Woman 127 the better. The helpmate of the labouring man has become his counsel- lor, and the idea that there must be a master and a slave in the household has disappeared. Hus- band and wife we find to-day on equal terms, each attend- ing to his or her duties, and especially amongst the farmers, where we may fre- ™^ \'■""^^ wadake wolteh, court actress. quently see that the woman occupies the superior position in the household. In order to perpetuate the work of his beloved consort, Francis Joseph has established a new order for women, called the Elizabeth Order, and the rescript which was issued with the establishment of this decoration shows how completely Francis Joseph under- stood and appreciated the influence which his wife had brought to bear upon the female portion of his Empire. The Emperor wrote thus to the Minister of the imperial house, Count Golutowsky ; — ^ K 128 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria "" Bowed down by the deepest grief through the great loss which has come over my house and my peoples by the sudden death of my most beloved wife, the Empress and Queen Elizabeth, in order to create a perpetual memorial to the departed, I have decided to found an order for women, which I have named in memory of her whom I have so truly loved, and for whom I grieve so deeply, the Elizabeth Order."" And here follow the words to which I wish particu- larly to call the attention of my readers. The Emperor continues : — "" The late Empress had been all through her life anxious to do good, and to alleviate the suffering of her neighbours ; and therefore this new-founded order shall have the purpose of rewarding women and girls in every condition and in every sphere of life or profession for deeds of humanity or philanthropy, thus following the example set by the illustrious dead."" The first to receive this order was Countess Sztaray, who accompanied the late Empress when she was murdered by the dastardly hand of Lucheni. The sympathetic heart of the royal victim of an anarchist had ever been looking round to see where she might bring consolation and alleviation of suffering. With what compassion she entered the villa of the ex-Empress Eugenie at Cap Martin, embracing the sufferer warmly, and showing through that act that The Empress as a Woman 129 the change of position made no difference in her own feelings ! Never will it be forgotten with what tender love she attended the ex-Empress Charlotte of Mexico when the terrible death of her husband had darkened her intellect, and frequently would she visit the poor wife of the murdered Maximilian, who suffers mentally and lives a secluded life at Laeken, near Brussels in Belgium. 9 130 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Whenever the late Empress was needed at a place of misery, there, like a good fairy, she appeared, bringing help to the sick and poor. When during the wars the wounded soldiers arrived by rail at the hospitals in Vienna, she herself received them at the station, visited them day and night at the hospitals, consoling, assuring, alleviating. One of her noble deeds which has become known out of the many she was ever doing shows better than words the kindness of her heart. It was a young trooper, whose wounds were of such a nature that his recovery became almost an impossibility ; the Empress stood at his bedside, asking him if she could do anything for him, when he humbly informed her that his great wish was that a letter should be written to his mother, sister, and sweetheart, who were many miles away in Trans- Leithania, and whom he felt he would never see again. The imperial visitor promised that his desire should be carried into effect, and immediately on her return home she dispatched one of her equerries down to the little Carpathian village with orders to bring immediately the relatives of this soldier to Vienna, and a few days afterwards she personally had the pleasure of leading the poor old mother and the two younger women to the bedside of the cavalry- man. Who could describe the pleasure and happiness The Empress as a Woman 131 which existed for some hours at that sad bedside ? But a reward which was not expected came to Her Majesty : through the nursing of his loving relatives death was warded ofF, and in spite of the assertions of the doctor that his life could not be saved the young soldier recovered, and, liberally endowed by Her Majesty, was able within a year to be married 13^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria to the choice of his heart, who had assisted in nursing him back from death\'s door. But it was not only the wounded to whom the Empress gave sympathy. Frequently she spent hours at the bedside of sufferers in the hospitals in Austria and Hungary, lightening their heavy burdens by her charming conversation and her compassionate words, and more than once were the physicians obliged to request the exalted visitor to think of her own health and seek much-needed rest. In every aspect of her varied character she was admirable, in none more so than in her sympathy with the weak and suffering and her strict love of justice. Her sphere of benevolence was unlimited ; at home or abroad her purse was ever open to those who needed assistance. She was a bountiful bene- factress to the churches and charities in Paris, as in every place where she sojourned. Can it be wondered at, that, with such a woman at the head of society, the tone of it should be the best.? The Emperor, who so fully entered into the new spirit which the Empress had introduced, was always willing to recognise the merits of women in as full a measure as those of men, and on various occasions he showed pointedly his regard for the gentler sex. Some years ago he attended a Tyrolese rifle meeting at Innsbruck, and, joining in the spirit The Empress as a Woman 133 of the thing, not only distinguished the pretty peasant girl who was deputed to hand the Emperor flowers and his mug of wine by pressing a kiss upon her brow, but caused her to journey especially to Vienna to be received in private audience by the Empress, who presented her with a diamond cross as a souvenir. In the more intimate circle of the Emperor\'s family the prevailing tone is a most charming one ; the Archduchesses have laid aside all their stiffness of former years, and appear as women among women, and the Empress herself always advocated marriages where love should play a more important part than convenance. Her own youngest daughter was married to the choice of her heart, and no considerations were allowed to stand in her way. Even in cases of mesalliances the Empress had always shown great kindness and friendliness to the ladies who have been 134 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria * chosen as spouses by her relations, and never allowed them to feel in any way their inferiority of birth. It was often said that no one could be a truer and more sincere friend than the Empress Elizabeth, and those to whom she allowed the privilege of joining the circle of her friends were soon convinced of her unselfishness, true kindness, and noble nature. The ladies of her Court worshipped her ; the gentlemen would willingly, one and all, have laid down their lives for their imperial mistress. Her servants, of whom a great many were English and Irish, showed always the greatest devotion to her, and to be in her personal service was considered one of the most coveted of positions. One of the privileges of the Empress of Austria is the nomination of \'\' Palast Damen "" (ladies of the palace), a much-coveted dignity, as it gives the free eniree to the more intime Court circle, and would correspond perhaps with our extra or honorary ladies- in-waiting. Elizabeth was most happy in her selec- tions, but even here she could not free herself entirely from her love for the beautiful, and it was often stated by connoisseurs that the bevy of lovely young women and girls with whom she liked to surround herself afforded a most charming picture. Many of those whom she especially honoured with her friendship are amongst the past and present beauties of the The Empress as a Woman 135 Empire. Some of our portraits will speak for them- selves, and confirm what can only be inadequately descriixd. The Princess Montenuovo and the Countesses Pototzka, Wyden- bruck, Josephine Kinsky, and Haas- Wachter are a few of the galaxy. The spirit of chivalry which Her Majesty implanted in Austrian society has been marve- lous ; and one of the first instances — quite a typical one —is the deed of a ,„^.„,„ j„,„„,^.^ ^,„^^^ woman, the sister- in-law of the Empress, the Archduchess Marie Theresa, who actually put to shame the stronger sex in an emergency. When staying at her country residence, a fire broke out in a village in the neighbourhood ; whereupon she instantly ordered her carriage, and drove to the scene of the conflagration ; there she learnt that in one of the rooms of the house a little child was imprisoned ; seeing the men standing 1 13^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria around reluctant to risk their lives, she dashed up the burning staircase before anybody had time to prevent her, returning in a few moments with the child practically unhurt in her arms. The brave Princess\'s hair was scorched and burnt, and her hands were badly injured, but she refused to receive medical aid until the doctor had satisfied her that the little one was unhurt. Although herself overwhelmed by a burden of mis- fortunes, Elizabeth never seemed happier than when able to act the part of the consoling angel ; and her friendship, love, and almost reverence for those who had passed through distress and bitter woe were un- speakably strong and heartfelt; it was for this reason that she harboured in her heart so much devotion and esteem for the venerable ex-Queen of Hanover, the oldest royal lady now living, who, since her late husband lost his throne, has made her home in the Austrian Empire. Naturally all the great philanthropic and charitable institutions in Austria and Hungary, and even some in foreign countries, were under the protection of the Empress; and in 1875, at the one-hundredth year of its existence, the Institute for the Free Education of Officers\' Daughters received her special attention. She sent a donation of ten thousand florins, and made a strong appeal to the public on behalf of the institu- The Empress as a Woman 137 tioti ; and, to her great pleasure, this resulted in an addition to its funds of more than half a million fiorins. In a simi- lar way she helped the Establishment for the Care of Daughters of Poor Civil Servants. In 1878, after the occupation by Austria of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during which so many soldiers lost their lives, she perceived the necessity for the establishment of a regular fund for the assistance of those who were wounded or ill. In the letter written by her own hand to the Prime Minister, she proposed the formation of the Patriotic Women\'s Union for the purpose of assisting soldiers in poor circumstances, and of nursing the sick and wounded. This fund is now well established, and the members, who reside in all parts of the vast Empire, are intimately united in carrying out 13^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria the benevolent intentions of the "" mother of the country."" In closing this chapter I cannot forego repeating THE EX-QtIEEN the conviction, that, however nobly the murdered Empress may stand out as the mistress of a great Court, as the consort of a powerful Emperor, as The Empress as a Woman 139 mother, student, philanthropist, as a woman among women, her memory must shine with a yet greater lustre. Her husband, the Emperor himself, paid her, per- haps, the highest compliment, when, in addressing an assembly of his loyal Hungarians some time ago, he spoke these memorable words : "" Without her I could never have done the work that God has given me to do."" CHAPTER V. THE EMPRESS AS A STUDENT AND READER, 141 CHAPTER V. THE EMPRESS AS A STUDENT AND READER. SO lofty a character as that of the Empress Elizabeth must needs show a great leaning towards poetry, music, and art. That she found great consolation and forgetful ness of uncongenial realities whenever she could give herself up entirely to the pathos and poesy of her favourite writers has been frequently proved, and studies of the sublime and noble rendered her oblivious of the prose of every-day life. The melancholy music of the lyre of Heinrich Heine had a soothing influence upon her, and it is no doubt for that reason that she loved him so dearly. We are able to give in translation the poems she especially admired, and which are marked in her volumes, and show traces of their frequent perusal, even to the distinct marks of tears which had fallen on the pages as they were read. "" Your little hand lay on my heart, dearest dear ! Do you in that small room a great knocking hear? There a carpenter dwells, hard and cunning is he, Who is nailing together a coffin for met 143 144 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Such hammering and knocking, by night and by day ! Long since it has driven my sleep quite away. Be quick now, Master Carpenter, please ! So that I soon may sleep at ease ! "" ""Thy face so sweet and fair doth seem; Of late I saw it, but in dream : So mild in its angelic grace. But pale, with sorrow pale, thy face. Only the lips like rosebuds blow. But, kissed by death, soon blanched grow; To heaven withdrawn, from whence it came ; Of holy eyes the dying flame.\'* ""There stands a fir tree lonely On a naked Norland height ; He sleeps — ice and snow enfold him Beneath a coverlet white. He dreams there of a palm tree In the Morning-land afar, Lonely in silent sorrow On a bare cliff\'s burning scaur."" ""Death is the cool and quiet night. And life the weary, sultry day ; The darkness falls — I sleep away The toils and troubles of the light."" Her veneration for the German bard took also a practical form. She never visited Paris without making \' ] The Empress as a Student and Reader H? a pilgrimage to his grave in the Montmartre Cemetery. She has even left the record of one of these visits to the burial-place of her favourite author in some verses, noting in these compositions that before reaching "" God\'s acre "" she went to the church of Notre Dame des Victoires, in order to pray for the repose of the soul of her beloved poet. She also gave instructions to have the grave taken care of and flowers placed upon it from time to time. The Empress was an enthusiast for all that was English, and her studies of English literature were continuous. She was a devoted Shakespearian scholar, and her own commentator; she translated his Tempest ^ Hamlet y King Lear^ and parts of others of his immortal plays into modern Greek. Next in favour was Byron and after him Longfellow. Of prose- writers she especially admired George Eliot and Lord Byron, but she read also with great interest the novels of Mrs. Humphry Ward, and was much impressed by Florence Marryat\'s *\' The Blood of the Vampire."" She is also reported to have been particularly struck with the imaginative power of Marie Corel] i\'s writings, and only this year (1898) she sent her a letter assuring her that her books had given her many hours of happiness and rest. The Empress regretted that the novelist should have vented her own private grievances against the critics, and t. 1 4^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria considered that in those passages Marie Corelli had been guilty of a literary indiscretion which somewhat marred the beauty of the story. It was a strange coincidence that the last English novel the Empress read with her permanent English reader, Mr. Barker, should have been Marion Crawford\'s *\' Corleone,"" which deals with the organisa- tion of the Maffia in Sicily. She was strongly moved by the horrors of the work. Mr. Barker states that he selected "" Corleone "" in order to make the Empress familiar with the murderous machinations of blood- thirsty wretches, hoping it might lead to her taking more care of her personal safety. It will throw some light upon the characteristics of the Empress Elizabeth, if we show how it came about that she engaged Mr. Barker as her reader. The gentleman in question seems a veritable per- sonage out of the Orient of one\'s travels, combined with the living plastic of a Greek "" study "" in modern garb. We cannot do better than report verbatim the interview the correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette had with Mr. Barker shortly after the assassination of his imperial mistress : — "" Mr. Barker himself must have noticed my curiosity, and proceeded to explain. "" M am an Englishman, although you perhaps wonder The Empress as a Student and Reader 149 how that can be. Well, my father was an English- man and my mother an Oriental. My grandfather was British Consul in Egypt. How did I become acquainted with the Empress ? Oh, that was at Alexandria in 1891 — a very interesting episode. I was lying ill from malaria, caught at Corfu, when my favourite brother and intimate friend — you smile at that expression, but surely a relative is nbt necessarily a friend ! — rushed in one day with the intelligence that the Empress was at Cairo. "" Frederick ! "" he said, "" write a poem about her palace at Corfu and dedicate it to her."" I laughed at the idea. I believe I said in my impatience, "" Confound the Empress ! "" But, anyhow, I allowed myself to be persuaded, and a few months later I received an invitation to visit her on board the Miramare^ lying in Alexandria Harbour. Her Majesty was sitting alone on deck. She thanked me in that sweet manner that was hers for the poem, and put questions to me in various languages. Half an hour afterwards the Miramare sailed. « i « ""Yh^ gentleman who writes Greek so well,"" as she described me, did not see her again until the spring of 1892, when she asked me if I would join her for a couple of months on a trip. Those two months were extended to thirteen, and in 1897 I was appointed her permanent reader. And now the end h^s come — the end, per Dio^ to a life that w^s ^n 150 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria earthly paradise. The world will surely never see her like again.\' "" * You were very much with the Empress, I believe ? \' "" \' Yes, sometimes as much as twelve hours a day. You see I am a linguist, and if her Majesty was not speaking Hungarian with Countess Sztaray, she was chatting Greek, Italian, French, or English with me.\' "" Mr. Barker states that the late Empress spoke y English better than German. "" When she was feeling well, we would start reading at about half-past eight o\'clock. Sometimes I would sit and sing to her some of my Greek pastorals and lyrics on the guitar. She was herself a poetess-:-! might say a demi-goddess."" With these words Mr. Barker terminated his interview with the Pall Mall Gazette correspondent. I may mention here that the Empress found also much pleasure in- the Irish tales of Charles Lever, whose personal acquaintance she had made during the time the novelist was British Consul in Trieste. The Empress did not neglect French authors, past and present, as she read the works of Jean Jacques ^ Rousseau, and often was she seen with a volume of Victor Hugo as her companion ; it was said, too, that she paid great attention to the works of Voltaire and Lamartine. A§ an accomplished linguist, she was able to r^ad The Empress as a Student and Reader 151 most of the works of literary merit in the original. She spoke and wrote fluently and even elegantly German, Hungarian, Czechish, Polish, Roumanian, Italian, Romanic (modern Greek), English, and French, besides Latin and ancient Greek. As she took up new studies from time to time, she engaged as her teachers men well known and renowned. One of these, Mr. Russo Poulos, Oriental Professor at the Vienna University, was her Greek teacher and reader, and he has written an interesting article about the linguistic attainments of the Empress. "" It was in a lovely spot,"" he writes, ** where the palace of the Achilleon now stands, that Her Majesty first lived in a tiny house, near .the village of Gasturi. Here, amid the olive groves, with a distant view of Corfu and the Albanian mountains before her eyes, she became enchanted with the Greek scenery and language. She visited every historic spot, and made endless excursions in the hills. For nine months she studied Greek, and when she knew the modern language she desired also to be acquainted with the ancient tongue."" In 1889 Mr. Russo Poulos went to Corfu, where Her Majesty studied Greek throughout the whole winter. She learnt rapidly, and her sympathy with the Greek people aided her greatly. During voyages to Tunis and Malta her studies were pursued unremittingly. \'j 152 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria The poems of Christopoulos Balaurides were especially beloved by the Empress ; she read the Odyssey in modern Greek with ardour, and also studied some works of Heine in the same language. Although only engaged for one year, Mr. Russo Poulos remained for three, and Her Majesty attained the highest proficiency in modern Greek. The Emperor was often present at the lessons, and followed his wife\'s progress with interest. She was perfectly at home when in the society of scientists, poets, painters, and artists in general ; and although her early experience in Vienna did not con- tribute towards making the capital a favourite spot with her, still she loved it as the centre of literature, art, and music ; and she bestowed her sincere friendship on many men of letters, painters, and musicians, and numbered Wagner,* Liszt, Makart, Munkacsy, and many others amongst her intimates. The paintings of Munkacsy especially impressed her very strongly, and she frequently visited his studio and remained for hours in conversation with him. He is a fine-looking man, tall, broad, and erect, inclined, if anything, to stoutness ; his dazzling white hair is brushed back, so that it stands all on end, and his white beard is combed out somewhat truculently. His cheek bones are high, his eyes small and deep-set, his skin and lips of unusual thickness. His name was originally ""Lieb,"" but in 1874 he was ] The Empress as a Student and Reader 153 created Count Munkacsy — Munkacs being his native town. The story goes that he began life as a carpenter ; but this employment being uncongenial to him, he soon found his way into some studio at Pesth, then at Vienna, and lastly in Munich. He is now one of the most celebrated painters of the century, and commands / 154 Elizabeth, Empress of Austriat very large sums for the sale of his pictures, of which perhaps the best known is "" Ecce Homo,"" so greatly admired in England. On similar friendly terms was the Empress with Makart, and many hours did she spend in his studio, which in itself was an art museum. In science she took great interest, and frequently commanded lectures at her apartments. She studied politics, although she never took an active part in them, and also national economy. Her views Were extremely broad, and Dr. Max Falk, who taught her Hungarian, and was a constitutionalist of the advanced school, tells us that she astounded him one day by asking him abruptly, \'* Is it also your opinion that the only sensible form of State government is the Republican ? "" "" What suggested this question to Your Majesty ? "" stammered FaJk. "" Oh,"" rejoined the Empress, "" it is a question which I often used to discuss with Count Maylath, and I should like to know what you have to say about it."" She was perfectly open-minded in respect to social and political issues calling for solution. Although her inherited instincts caused her to be against democratic governments, she was still keenly perceptive by the light of present-day thought and intelligence of the failings and drawbacks of personal government. She joyfully welcomed learned societies, and it gave The Empress as a Student and Reader 155 her unalloyed pleasure to entertain them. In 1862 there met in Vienna the International Society of Jurists (Juristentag), and upon the Initiative of Her Majesty all the members were hospitably received at Schonbrunn, and it was observed on that occasion how well informed the Empress was even then, at the age of twenty-five, and how she entered into animated conversation with various men of great renown, showing no mean amount of knowledge in that branch of science. Such admiration did she win at that time, that spontaneously a demonstration was prepared to do her public honour, and on the 25th of August a monster torch-light procession moved to the suburban castle, the torch-bearers consisting principally of the members of all the learned societies of Vienna, of foreign guests, and of philanthropic and art institu- tions, etc., making a mass of more than ten thousand persons. The Mayor of Vienna was received by the Empress on the balcony of the imperial residence, where she accepted a large bouquet of flowers from his hands, which was offered as a token of the people\'s esteem and love, and as a mark of admiration from men of letters and of scientists and artists especially. Elizabeth, in replying to the short speech of the Mayor, said that the memory of that day would always be one of the most valqable, and that she f^lt tt\\o^t 156 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria honoured by the ovation. She was indeed greatly touched by the demonstration, which so clearly showed that she was appreciated by men of learning and lovers of science. Her love of knowledge was no doubt inherited from her father, and was again visibly transmitted to her children, whose turn of mind runs distinctly in the same groove. The late Crown Prince was an ardent student, especially of natural history, and both Princess Gisela and the Archduchess Valerie are interested in science and art to a great extent. Her Majesty\'s selection of persons who should superintend her children\'s education showed her good sense and liberal ideas. Bishop Ronay, the Hungarian, to whom was entrusted the education of the Arch- duchess Valerie, has given to the world in an interesting little work containing his reminiscences the instruc- tions given to him by the Empress personally. "" I wish my daughter to be initiated in all sciences of the day. I prefer that she should have only one teacher — yourself,"" said the Empress to the Bishop. \'\' I want her to be educated on religious principles, but by no means in narrow-mindedness and fanaticism. Let her be taught to the widest extent by that great teacher of us all — Nature."" To her Greek studies the Empress was, as we have before intimated, very devoted ; and having mastered THEN E \'A\' YORK PUBLIC; ::,iu?^Y A8TOH, Lfc \'OX -Ni\' TILO£N FOUND/ T\'\'^ «. The Empress as a Student and Reader 159 the language, she loved to surround herself with men and women who shared with herself a love of classic lore — like Dr. Christomanos and many others. In music she was proficient on the piano, and later in life took anew lessons from Abbe Liszt, for whom she had the greatest veneration. She considered it a special privilege to be allowed to play with \\y him in duet. The Rhapsodic Hongroisiey his com- position, was one of her most favoured pieces. Wagner she admired, but perhaps more as a poet than as a musician. Rub^stein was also a great favourite ; but Chopin touched her most strongly, and she never tired of playing or hearing his Nocturnes, which are so full of deep feeling. A more simple instrument upon which she liked to play, and which was taught her by her father, was the Alpine zither. She played it remarkably well and with great expression, such as one would hardly believe could possibly be drawn from so simple a contrivance as the zither. She performed on various occasions at charity concerts, and was certainly far above the average amateur musician. It was one of her most distinct characteristics that whatever she undertook she carried to a successful issue, and her tenacity was well known. She was also the happy possessor of great patience, and her readers tell us that when the read- ing of a new novel or any literary production was i6o Elizabeth, Empress of Austria commenced she never would allow it to be left un- finished, even if it bored her. "" One never knows/\' she used to say, "" what it may be — the ending may be good enough to make up for the poor beginning."" It was one of the highly esteemed prerogatives of the imperial lady to seek out struggling young artists and litterateurs^ and afFord them such assistance as would allow their talents to have full scope ; and many were her personal pensioners who gratefully and lovingly worked in Rome and other art centres in the hope of rewarding their noble patroness at some future day by a life-long devotion and gratitude. But what she did was from feelings dictated by her conscience, which told her that it was her duty in her position to assist in the development of talents which a Higher Being than herself had planted in the hearts of recipients of her bounty : sufficient reward did she find in their success. Her exalted position and her wealth, combined with her love and admiration for the fine arts, made her naturally a great patroness of artists ; and her personal collection of pictures and statuary, as well as of other works of art, was perhaps one of the finest possessed by any private person. Certainly it can be said that the Empress Elizabeth occupied a high place in the world of science, literature, music, and art, and that her tastes were distinguished The Empress as a Student and Reader i6i by a chastity and elevation rarely to be found at the present time ; but especially remarkable was the variety and Catholicism of the subjects which arrested the attention of this imperial scholar and the wide scope of her interests and studies. » : I I CHAPTER VI. THE EMPRESS AS AN ARCHITECT, \'63 tl CHAPTER VI. THE EMPRESS AS AN ARCHITECT. THERE is traceable in the race of the Wittelsbachs a very strong propensity to create architectural monuments, to beautify and build. Ludwig I. of Bavaria changed Old Munich into a modern Athens, his son Max continued the work, and the fantastic Ludwig II. left behind him palaces and castles not rivalled in grandeur and magnificence in the whole world. The same spirit constrained the Empress Elizabeth to erect palaces which should be her own conception and would exactly suit her tastes. It was for this reason that Her Majesty, although having at her disposal more than fifty residences, castles, and villas, craved for structures with which she might be fully identified and individually connected, which should be her own property, and represent as much as possible her ideal ; and in this way arose such palaces as Lainz near Vienna and the Achilleon in Corfu. At her coronation in Hungary the nation presented their Queen with the Castle of Goddlo, and this has 165 1 66 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria remained ever one of her favourite residences. How- ever, I do not intend here to speak of this country seat, which was also her hunting-box : I mean to devote this chapter only to the two buildings which she herself conceived, planned, and completed, and which stamped her as an architect of the noblest taste, and proved her love for the beautiful, pure, and simple. That she was greatly influenced when building the Achilleon by her love for Greece, ancient and modern, is evident ; whereas Lainz, which represents the modern architectural school, shows us that her appreciation of beauty was not narrowed or limited to one style. Very few even of those who know Vienna will have ever seen the beautiful retreat of the late Empress at Lainz. Although within driving distance of the capital, one might believe it to be many miles away in the country. The grounds are laid out by the cleverest of landscape gardeners, and seem many times more spacious than they really are. The flower gardens are magnifi- cent, especially in the early spring, when they are filled with the finest varieties of hyacinths and tulips. Large beds of lilies-of-the-valley and violets simulate a carpet and are a triumph in that style of gardening. In the summer there is a great variety of lilies to be seen, and the show of chrysanthemums in the autumn is also most lovely. The palace itself is comparatively small, but by clever contrivance it was mad? to accommodate the The Empress as an Architect 167 suite of the Empress, which, even when cut down on a visit to Lainz, was of goodly nlimbers. A peculiarity of the house is the chapel, if I may call it by this name. The Empress had arranged in the hall an alcove, which contains an altar, upon which every morning Mass was said by one of Her Majesty\'s chaplains. A large mirror, which can be moved by a hidden spring, glides from wall to wall, and generally covers the alcove, so that no trace of an altar is visible. The Empress\'s bedroom contains a beautiful replica in pale pink Sicilian marble of the Niobe in the Uffizi / 1 68 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Gallery in Florence, surrounded with ferns and minia- ture palms, the whok being lit up by small electric jets during the night. But the better-known architectural work of Her Majesty is the villa which she erected in Corfu, and which she called, after the Homeric hero Achilleus, the Achilleon. As far back as 1861, when she had spent a winter in Madeira on the advice of her physicians and returned in the late spring to Trieste, she visited on her way the Island of Corfu, and remained there some days, staying at the Villa ** Mon Repos,"" then the summer residence of the Lord High Commissioner for the British Government, which was placed at her disposal. She at once became greatly charmed with the semi-tropical scenery ; and becoming more and more enchanted with it, felt a great desire to build an establishment for herself on this charming isle. Corfu is best known to those who have studied Greek history and read the poems of the immortal [ Homer as Corcyra, and is supposed to be the Scheria where Ulysses in his wanderings found the Phaeacians. j It was on these shores where Nausicaa, the most \', charming maiden that ever turned her fingers to j homely housework, took her father\'s clothes to wash, i[ and escorted the much-tried warrior within reach of ]. security. It was on this island that Ulysses gave much !l ""1 • 4 \\^ « 1 ^ \' r At. \'Oh, L=^NOX AND «* .aL.> FcU.>iO/.TlON«. if\' The Empress as an Architect 171 of the remarkable and almost incredible history of his wanderings. In more recent times Corfu was known as Corcyra, the headquarters of the innumerable pirates who in those days endangered navigation. As early as 229 B.C. the island came under the sway of the Romans. We find little recorded of the history of Corfu up to 1205, when it was in the possesssion of the Venetians till 1797, with the exception of one century. From 1 807-1 814 it was occupied by the French, and fron 18 15-1863 it formed one of the seven islands of the Ionian League under a British Lord High Commissioner, till at last in November 1863 it was incorporated in the kingdom of Greece. Elizabeth purchased the ruined Villa Braila, near Gasturi, situated on a wooded hill — a most charming spot, from which a very fine view is obtained of the blue stretch of ocean, the undulating verdure-clad slopes of the island, and the distant shore of Albania. In the Bay of Gasturi the Empress built a jetty of white marble to facilitate the landing from her yacht. Near the landing-stage stands a white building, the engine-house for the generation of electricity used for the lighting of the park and castle, and hence in straight line between ever-blooming orange trees and mighty cypresses and olives a road leads up to the palace. The whole mountain is covered with thick vegetation, and beside the semi-tropical foliage can b^ 172 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria seen the black oak and the yellow broom, while the ground is covered with anemones and daisies. As an entrance to the park there are erected most artistic wrought-iron gates, and on passing through one finds oneself at the foot of marble terraces ; there is a large ornamental fountain, and graceful staircases lead on both sides up to the terrace ; marble steps The Empress as an Architect i73 lead up higher and higher, till an antique temple is reached, which the mistress of the Achilleon consecrated to her favourite poet, Heinrich Heine. White columns support a cupola crowned by an angel holding a wreath of laurels in his hands. Under the cupola there is a life-like statue of the singer of love 174 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria and woe ; worn out he seems, sitting in an armchair, his knees covered with a woollen coverlet, his head sunk upon his breast, and with eyes which appear to be filled with tears he looks out upon the blue sea and upon the far-stretching purple mountains ; in his hand he holds a scroll, upon which there is written : — "" What means this lonely tear ? It still dims my view, So many years It lingers in my eyes. > • • * Thou lone and lingering tear, Dissolve now also."" The work was done by a renowned Danish sculptor, Louis Hasselriis, in Rome, who, himself a warm admirer of the poet, has put much spirit into the statue. All round the temple there are ancient cypress and gigantic olive trees. Behind the temple is situated what may be called the most beautiful wild park which the sunny South and the art of the landscape gardener could create. Various roads and avenues lead hence up to the White Palace, which takes its name from that hero who was a type of everything that was noble, powerful, and grand in the classic history of Ancient Greece. As soon as the Fimpress had decided to build a home for herself on that classic ground, she consulted The Empress as an Architect 17s the inspired word-painter of ancient lore, Alexander, Baron of Warsberg. It was he who first designed the plans for the palace, which the Em- press afterwards altered according to her own idea. The situation is unique ; the Empress selected the site herself, and created upon the ruins of the old villa the Achilleon, with a magnificent peristyle, atrium, and a garden of muses. RafFaele Carito, a celebrated architect of Naples, changed the ideal plan of the castle into such an one as could Be carried into modern reality. However, nothing was done without the full consent of the Empress, who was in daily consultation with the architect. The Achilleon lies to the south of the capital, Doric is the predominant type of architecture, with a slight intermixture of Ionic. The colonnade on the east is especially fine, and is 176 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria ornamented with frescoes of great artistic beauty. The subjects chosen are Apollo and Daphne, blind Homer reaching for his lyre, Theseus and Ariadne, and ^sop, surrounded by an entranced multitude, reading his fables to them. The colouring of these pictures is most remarkable and rich. It was only possible for an empress, and only for such an empress as ^ Elizabeth was, to build a palace as we see here in its superb whiteness standing in its dark green surroundings. The grounds are ornamented with the finest statues procurable, both antique and modern, amongst which perhaps the most beautiful are those of the Dying Achilleus and the Peri (Byron). The rooms Her Majesty used are situated on the third floor, which opens on to the hill side, and leads into the Garden of the Muses — a square surrounded by high cypress trees and statues of more than life size. Her Majesty was thus enabled to step out into the grounds without disturbing any of her household. In these apartments she was entirely alone. In the storey below there was a suite of rooms for the Emperor and another for her daughter Valerie. I will endeavour to describe the palace, as far as words can do so. In front there is a grand portico, which leads into the open atrium ; heavy purple velvet curtains divide the outer from the inner colon- nade, the floors being inlaid with many-coloured marble . v.; I \' • i J The Empress as an Architect 179 slabs, whilst a most graceful and light staircase leads to the upper storeys. The hall is adorned with frescoes representing dancing nymphs, and is turned almost into a winter garden through the presence of many fan-shaped palms stretching up to the ceiling. Here is the smoking-room, a library, sitting-rooms, and the dining-room for the household ; all are of fine dimensions and in pure classic style, as far as the demands of the present render it possible. The stair- case is in the Greek Pompeian style ; a large skylight allows the light to fall down and show to full ad- vantage the colossal ^^^^ fresco painting which fills one whole side of the walls, representing the Triumph of Achilleus as he is dragging the corpse of Hector round the fallen walls of Troy. The apartments of Elizabeth herself are the most i8o Elizabeth, Empress of Austria ideal one can imagine ; and the spirit of poetry- melancholy ever makes itself felt. Everything here she has endowed with her own individuality ; every piece of carving, every painting or statue, was selected by herself. The rooms are in accordance with the descriptions of those said to have been occupied by Penelope and Helena ; even her bedstead, which stands only about eight inches from the floor, is shaped according to the descriptions contained in the ancient epic ; the four posts are adorned with smiling wood nymphs, and a rich silken cover is negligently thrown over the white linen sheets and pillows. The most valuable and chaste collection is formed by the statues which adorn the so-called Garden of the Muses ; they are mostly works of the classic art which were brought from Rome, where the Empress purchased them from Prince Borghese. There is one statue here, not practically belonging to this classic company, which is Canova\'s "" Third "" Dancer, for which it is rumoured the lovely Princess Paulina Borghese, sister to Napoleon I., stood as a model. The Dying Achilleus is by the Berlin sculptor Ernest Herter. The Empress also erected a statue of Lord Byron in memory of that Anglo-Greek patriot and singer. Even the furniture was made, according to the strictest instructions of Her Majesty, from the designs The Empress as an Architect i8i of Professor Caponetti in the Albergo dei Poveri in Naples. Here one finds lovely chairs inlaid with silver and ivory, covered with sheep\'s fleeces ; also beautifully polished tables, sofas, and other ornaments, like those mentioned in Homer\'s poems, or made after the models which were excavated in Pompeii and Herculaneum. One of the favourite spots in this fairy-like scene was the terrace, over which there was spread an awning of antique cloth. On a wind-exposed corner there was fixed an ^olian harp ; and one view was of the blue sea ; while a marble bench formed in a half- circle reminded one of the ancient Greek seats, as we see them so fi-equently represented in the pictures by Alma Tadema. Here we are reminded of that wonderful artificial cave built by King Ludwig II., at an enormous cost, at the Linderhof ; the Empress having had constructed a similar cave, the entrance to which is almost covered with maidenhair ferns of gigantic size. On the back- ground of the interior large mirrors throw back a misty green light, and a small rivulet descends with its melancholy murmur. Nymphs and fauns seemed to have had a particular charm for the romantic and some- what fantastic Empress, and the park and gardens are dotted with statues of that class. Here, in this secluded paradise, the exalted lady spent many months of the year, accompanied by her 1 82 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria youngest daughter, and visited at short intervals by the venerable Eniperor. Willingly did she give up her days to those who loved her ; but the nights were her own ; and when all was still, and the moon- light was bathing the scenery with its hazy silver, the Empress could be seen wandering through the gardens, ascending the mountain tops, promenading the avenues, or standing in deep contemplation before one or other of her favourite statues. After the death of her only son, the Crown Prince Rudolf, in 1889, ^^^ erected to his memory a monument in one of the most enchanting spots of her domain, and here she was frequently found standing in deep thought and meditation, forgetful of the passing time, when the first rays of the rising sun threw their light upon the gardens. She was idolised by the people of the island, her kind, sympathetic heart often constraining her to visit the poor fisher-folk\'s homes ; and soon would her affability, her sweetness of temperament, and her charm of manner brighten up the poorest hut ; but never did she leave those whom she found in need without giving sufficient to at least alleviate their sufferings for some time to come. "" The Queen of the Achilleon "" §he was called first by the inhabitants of the neighbour- ing villages, but later she received the appellation of ""The Recluse of the Achilleon."" When she went The Empress as an Architect 185 through the villages the people rose, and blessings were showered upon her, and women often would run to her to kiss the hem of her dress. In her last will and testament the late Empress has left the Achilleon to her elder daughter. Princess Gisela of Bavaria, and Lainz to the younger, Princess Valerie. CHAPTER VII. THE EMPRESS AS A SPORTSWOMAN, 187 CHAPTER VII. THE EMPRESS AS A SPORTSWOMAN, IN our own country the Empress was best known before her death as a great sportswoman. From her very first youth riding was one of her greatest pleasures, and well was she known in the hills and dales surrounding her paternal castle. After she had become Empress she was able fully to indulge in this passion, and her stables in Vienna and Godolo contained the finest studs to be found in Europe. It was she who introduced fox-hunting into Austria and Hungary. Her Majesty herself hunted for many years in Hungary, making Godolo her headquarters. Her figure became very famous at the celebrated meets of Kaposztas Magyar. It is well known that there are no people in Europe more accustomed to riding than the Hungarians, a child hardly ever reaching the age of four without being able to keep itself on a horse\'s back. The introduction of fox-hunting by Queen Elizabeth created quite a sensation, though now there 189 190 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria are several packs regularly, hunted by Hungarian noblemen. It is certain that within twenty years fox-hunting will be as popular in the land of the Magyars as it is in our own country. In fact, it has been even introduced in mountainous Tyrol, where the Sporting Club is now keeping and hunting a good pack. However, the sport never was the same as it is with us, and nothing therefore was more natural than that the Empress should have desired to come to England to participate in the national sport here. She was a thorough-going huntswoman : in Meath, Cheshire, and Northamptonshire she enjoyed to the full the excitement and pleasures of hunting. She first came to England twenty-one years ago, and hunted with the Pytchley Hounds, of which Earl Spencer was then the master. She took Cottesbrook Park in Northamptonshire for six weeks, and I cannot do better than quote such an expert as the late Mr. H. O. Nethercote as to the impression the Empress left behind her. "" It was at once remarked by the large field, which respectfully saluted her on her first appearance with the Pytchleys, that her seat on horseback was extremely graceful, that her hands were perfect, and when the hounds began to run in earnest that there was no fence big enough to stop her."" The Empress as a Sportswoman 191 During her stay at Cottesbrook Park the Empress was present at all the best-known fixtures, riding three horses a day, which enabled her to hold her own against the best-mounted and the best-nerved. It was entirely through her instrumentality that the Hoffinghill Steeplechases, near Brixworth, were revived, and to the funds of that hunt-meeting she was a munificent subscriber. Whilst sojourning in the county of Meath, which was in the second year of her hunting-season in our islands (1879), ^^^ ^^^ accompanied by Prince Liechtenstein and piloted by the late Captain "" Bay "" Middleton. She usually rode a fine chestnut mare, and wore a dark blue riding-habit with gold buttons, a high hat, and white scarf. There was a strange peculiarity observable — namely, that she used to carry, besides the crop, a small fan in one of her hands, which she used after a run was over. Among the gentlemen in the field were Captain ""Jock"" Trotter, Earl Spencer, Lord Randolph Churchill, Lord Killeen, General Fraser, the Honourable H. Plunkett, the Honourable H. Boscawen, and the Honourable Henry Bourke. The Empress rode exceedingly well, frequently taking and keeping the lead, and carrying away many a brush. She had only one serious accident during her hunting in Ireland, and this was when riding The Widow, when she had 19^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria a really big fall, but fortunately was not seriously injured. The country in which the Meath Hounds met is the largest in the United Kingdom, stretching from Cabra Castle in Louth on the north, to Woodlands, the seat of Lord Annaly near Dublin, on the south, and from Lough Sheelin in West Meath to the sea- coast on the east. This enormous tract is nearly all grass, and among the finest land in Ireland. . When Her Majesty came first to Northamptonshire in 1878, she brought her own stud from Hungary ; but soon she became greatly interested in and enamoured of Irish hunters. The lamented death, shortly before her arrival, of Charles Brindley, the popular huntsman of the Ward Union Stag-Hounds, had enabled the Empress\'s agent to purchase the celebrated grey mare which had carried Brindley so magnificently in many a difficult run. In no Irish county has fox-hunting existed so long or been brought so nearly to perfection as in the county of Meath, for which thanks are due especially to Mr. Samuel Reynell of Archerstown, who it was that studded Royal Meath with gorse coverts. He was succeeded as master by Mr. Waller of Allenstown; but after five years he gave way to the finest rider that Meath ever saw. Captain "" Jock "" Trotter, who, although a Scotchman by birth, had become to all The Empress as a Sportswoman 193 intents and purposes an Irishman, and was one of the most popular men there. The Empress seemed never able to express enough praise for the hunting in Ireland, and returned there the following year, and, had it not been for the political disturbances which at that time made Ireland the \'3 1 194 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria hotbed of outrages and agrarian crimes, .she would no doubt have returned there every year ; as it was, she came again in 1880. She always travelled under the title of Countess of Hohenembs, and was attended by a large suite. She had procured as her hunting-box a house at Summer- hill, by no means a palatial home, but splendidly situated for the purpose for which she had hired it, where, it was reported, the first thing she did upon her arrival was to visit the stables and give a carrot to each of the hunters forming her stud there. So great was her passion for the field, that, in spite of the long and fatiguing journey from Vienna, she was out the very day following her arrival, and hunted with the Ward Stag-Hounds. Lord Langford was at that time master of the Wards, and amongst those who participated in the sport were such well-known men as Leonard Morrogh, Colonel Forbes, and the Earl of Mayo. Captain Middleton was again the Empress\'s pilot ; and although he was perhaps the most difficult man to follow. Her Majesty used to do it without ever failing. She was one of the most straight and hard- riding women with hounds ; and in the first week she. Captain "" Bay "" Middleton, and Bayzand, the personal attendant of the Empress, were all unseated in acci- dents in the field. Amongst her favourite hunters The Empress as a Sportswoman 195 were Domino, Cameo, Hard Times, Doctor, and St. Patrick, and it was often noticed that a peculiar affection existed between the hunters and their imperial mistress. An Irish lady who frequently accompanied the Empress in the field writes : — "" She was a most thoughtful and judicious rider, and eminently considerate for her mounts. I have seen her jump off with the lightness of a fawn when a check or a wait at covert side permitted, and almost unassisted shift her saddle slightly, always taking care that it was well clear of the play of the shoulders, and then from the pocket out would come sundry dainties, with which her favourites would be smilingly indulged. "" Her hands were the smallest I ever saw, and her hair the longest — it fell around her like a cloak when unloosed ; and I think I may add my own testimony that the heart which the dread assassin pierced was one of the kindest that ever beat in human breast. "" Arrived at the meet, we were told that the Empress had already come, and had gone to put on her habit at the neighbouring house ; so there was time to leave the carriage and go about greeting friends. I remember that Lord Combermere was there, and Sir Philip Egerton, and the veteran sportsman Mr. Nathaniel Cooke. "" It was frequently after eleven o\'clock when the 196 Elizabeth^ Hmpress of Austria Empress came upon the scene, riding a good-looking bay mare ; and with her was Lady Rocksavage, whose mount was a dappled grey. Her Majesty on this occasion\' wore a silk hat, rather low in the crown, and a dark blue habit, with a collar of sable fur ; her gloves were of\' strong tan leather. "" She always was riding a level-seat saddle, cut away at the withers and neatly flapped over ; and in the pouch at the side were sundry bits of biscuit and lump sugar, with which she occasionally fed her horses."" The last run the Empress enjoyed in Ireland was on the back of St. Patrick, and she often deplored her inability to hunt again in that paradise of fox- hunting. She came to Ireland without any pretensions of State, and her master of horse was Prince Liechtenstein, a smart, wiry, good-looking Austrian, not young, but well preserved, his small pointed beard just showing a tinge of grey, and his keen, deep-set eyes a few wrinkles at the corners. He was a brisk and fearless horseman, was a pleasant conversationalist, and spoke English perfectly. The Empress seemed very nervous about her debut in Irish fields, and tried her best to avoid the crowd of gazers which always collected in the grounds of her hunting-box. Another lady who also frequently h%d the pleasure of hunting with Her Majesty says : — The Empress aa a Sportswoman "" The Empress had an exquisite figure, and her riding-dress was the admiration of every field which she graced whilst visiting in Ireland. So closely did h?r w?ll-cut skirt cling to her form th^t it was a 19^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria common saying among ladies that she must be \'sewn into it/ and that they did not believe she could dismount ; while her jackets, of absolutely perfect build, were fitted to a twenty-inch waist of exquisite and natural rounding. She either wore a high silk hat or a small Tyrolese hat of pliable felt, dented slightly in the centre of the crown and furnished with one little up-standing wing. I never saw her wear a flower or a neck-bow, or a pocket-handkerchief protruding from the front of her bodice. Her dress was simplicity itself, and its only noticeable adjunct was a black-and-yellow fan, very light and portable, and about as plain as it was possible for it to be. This was carried either in her hand or in a little slip strap in front of her saddle, and it always came out at covert side, and very frequently when trotting along the roadway. \' Afraid of her com- plexion,\' the Irish ladies said ; but it was not so at all ; no one ever guessed the wherefore of it, and this is my own very first mention of the matter. She had an absolute dread of the itinerant photo- grapher and of the sketcher, ever on the watch to snatch impressions of her truly lovely face."" She paid a short private visit to Ireland two or three years ago, her time being almost entirely spent in the West. She was always mindful of the poor people in the district where she stayed, and her acts The Empress as a Sportswoman 199 of benevolence are fondly remembered in many a lowly cottage in Meath and Kildare. As an instance of the indomitable pluck of the late Elizabeth of Austria I may give the following incident, which occurred during her stay in Meath. After a long run the hard-pressed fox jumped over the wall of Maynooth College, and rushed across the exercise ground where the students were pacing to and fro, evidently absorbed in pious contemplation (Maynooth College is an institution for the preparation and study of the Roman Catholic priesthood). The sight of a fox in the grounds roused the sporting instincts of the young clericals, inherent in most Irishmen, and they were on the point of giving chase when the wall was again cleared, this time by a beautiful woman on a spirited horse : it was the Empress of Austria, who had followed the fox through thick and thin, and evidently through water as well, as the dripping state of her habit testified. Dr. Walsh, now Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, and then the head master of Maynooth, received the imperial huntswoman with due courtesy, and, observing the danger which she ran of getting chilled in her wet clothes, suggested a wrap. Her Majesty willingly accepted the ofFer. But now arose a difficulty : there were no feminine habiliments to be found in that training establishment for young Yi 200 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria priests, and she had to make use of Dr. Walsh\'s academic gown, which she laughingly threw over her shoulders, and, after having partaken of refresh- ments with the president and professors, rode home. The Empress seemed so pleased with that accidental visit and the hospitality shown to her by the reverend gentleman, that shortly after she came \'again on a longer visit to Maynooth, and there, as elsewhere, charmed all by her grace and affability. On that occasion she presented Dr. Walsh with a beautiful diamond ring, and after she had returned to her home in Austria she sent the college a fine statuette in solid silver of St. George and the Dragon, and also a suit of vestments richly wrought of silk and gold, and covered all over with shamrocks worked in green silk. She certainly made many women friends in Ireland ; and it is a strange coincidence that in a letter to an Irish lady, written only a few months ago, she alluded to her sister\'s awful death at the bazaar fire in Paris, and remarked that she felt a presentiment that some tragedy was in store for herself. Her Majesty\'s last hunting season in this country was in 1881, when she rented Combermere Abbey in Cheshire for two months, from the i8th of February. She entrusted at that time an Irish horse-dealer with the task of buying hunters for her; and wh^n sh? The Empress as a Sportswoman 201 arrived at Combermere Abbey she found a superb stock of Irish horses awaiting her, with her principal hunting- groom, an Irishman of the name of Tom Healy, in charge. Combermere Abbey, Lord Combermere\'s seat in Cheshire, has long been tenanted by famous sportsmen, and is a good specimen of a nobleman\'s country seat in the North of England. No better choice could have been made, since from there it is feasible to easily reach both the Cheshire packs, Sir Watkin Wynn\'s, the North Staffordshire, and the Shropshire. As usual the Empress\'s hunting-stud comprised about thirty horses. Her pilot here was Colonel Charles Rivers Bulkeley, who, in addition to being a brilliant horseman, knew the whole country well, and, proved himself an admirable guide. One of the finest runs in which she participated was from the Bache House covert to the hills, in which even the magnificent horse upon which she was mounted proved none too fast. With reference to her horses, hardly one of which ever put a foot wrong, they were trained until it was almost a wonder that they were not sick of jumping and declined to face a fence at all. There was a special etiquette observed when the Empress was one of the field — namely, that no one should ride in front of her or her pilot ; and even if, owing to a turn made by the hounds, Her Majesty and her leader were pot at that 202 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria moment in front, those who were, were expected to fall out of the way ; while it was also customary for Lord Spencer, Captain Parke Yates, Mr. Corbet, or any man with whom the Empress might be hunting, to approach the imperial visitor hat in hand, and ask whether it was Her Majesty\'s pleasure that the hounds should draw again. Amongst her horses were Florae, Timon, and Ash town. She generally consulted, when buying horses, Mr. Edward Macdonald of Ashtowngate, and Mr. Allen McDonogh, then of Athgarvan Lodge, Curragh, who ranked at the time among the best judges of horse-flesh and the very best horsemen of the day. They are both dead now, as is also Captain Middleton, who was killed while riding in a steeplechase. The Empress\'s liberality was generally remarked upon ; she made presents with great freedom, even the station-masters on the smallest wayside stations through which she passed were remembered and surprised by the receipt of a pin, ring, or some other present of value. At the close of a season, and as a token of the great pleasure afl^^rded her, the Empress gave a prize, to be competed for by Northamptonshire farmers ; and when the prize had been won. Her Majesty gave a luncheon party, at which the Prince and Princess of Wales, the late Duchess of Teck, Earl and Countess The Empress as a Sportswoman 205 Spencer, and many others were present. Her gracious- ness and affability were most marked ; and her grroms and stablemen, for the most part Irish, absolutely worshipped her. She proved to be a practical horse- woman, and likewise a humane one. At the end of her first season in Northamptonshire, the Archduke Rudolf, Crown Prince of the Austrian Empire, came on a visit to England, Scotland, and Ireland, enjoying the field sports of the country. He was, in company with the Prince of Wales and Prince Louis Napoleon, a guest of the late Duke of Hamilton at Hamilton Palace in Lanarkshire. The purpose of his visit was to bring his mother home to Austria. The Empress was obliged, on account of failing health, to give up riding in 1882, and she felt the deprivation very much. She took up fencing, in which graceful art she became very proficient ; she also tried her hand at fishing, but that sport proved too slow for her active and restless temperament. She was an intrepid mountain climber, and a strong and skilful swimmer. One of her great pleasures was moun- taineering ; and up to the very end of her life she was accustomed to take long walks, frequently tiring her cavaliers and ladies without feeling fatigued herself. Her Majesty\'s hunting establishment in her own country was at the Castle of Godolo, near Buda-Pesth in Hungary. There she kept a fine stud and a pack 2o6 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria of hounds, and frequently hunted, accompanied by the Emperor and some of the Archdukes and intimate friends. When visiting her establishment, one would hardly have imagined it to be in Hungary ; all her grooms and stablemen were English or Irish, andevery- thing was done as she had seen it in Meath and the Shires. The rooms or the castle, which were given up to the paraphernalia of the hunt, were filled with brushes, spurs, crops, and hunting-fans, as she called them, and many mementoes of her various experiences in the hunting-field. During the latter years of her life Her Majesty became very fond of yachting, and the imperial yacht Miramare was often employed to carry her on long excursions in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. The Empress as a SFortswoman 207 She loved the ocean ; the stormier it was, the higher the winds and waves, the better pleased Elizabeth appeared to be. She generally remained with the captain on the bridge during the severest gales, and no remonstrances against her exposing herself to danger were of avail. She only shook her head, and bade her attendant go down into the cabin ; but she herself kept to the bridge as long as the gale lasted. The Miramare is a paddle steamer of an old design ; but her lines are greatly admired by experts and yachting people, and all her appliances are of the most modern style, the saloons and cabins being furnished according to Her Majesty\'s own suggestions. The yacht is very swift and graceful, and has accommodation for a large retinue ; on the deck arrangements were made to enable the Empress to indulge in her pleasure of walking exercise. CHAPTER VIII. THE EMPRESS AS A TRAVELLER, 209 14 ^ ! CHAPTER VIII, IHE EMPRESS AS A TRAVELLER. "" We change the surroundings, but a heart bleeds under all social variations."" — George Moore, ALTHOUGH the area over which the Empress Elizabeth travelled appears limited in com- parison with the known extent of the world, and in consideration of the facilities now offered to wander through it, she at least thoroughly saw and knew the different lands which she visited. Soon after her marriage she accompanied her hus- band on an extended tour through the various provinces of the Austrian Empire and through Hungary. In September 1856 she visited the magnificent mountain fastnesses of the Alpine countries, Styria and the Tyrol ; and on this occasion she climbed the highest mountain to be found in the Alps, the Grossglockner. The excursion was made from Heiligenblut, where their Majesties had been staying at the rectory. At four o\'clock in the morning they were present at Mass, and knelt devoutly before the altar, the Emperor in the national Tyrolese 211 212 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria costume, his spouse in a short woollen skirt, shirt, and light jacket. Accompanied by a few experienced guides, they commenced the ascent, the Empress and the majority of the suite on horseback, the Emperor always on foot, in order to lose no point of vantage. When they were about six thousand feet high, the Emperor plucked a most beautiful Edelweiss near a rocky preci- pice, and handed it to his wife with these words : "" This is the first time in my life that I have plucked the Edelweiss myself."" The Empress enjoyed the magnificent and far-extended view with almost child-like pleasure. How small appeared to her the mountains around Possenhofen which she knew so well, and how grand was this enormous pile of rock on the top of which she now stood, looking down upon the low-lying towns, villages, lakes, and mountain scenery ! A hut which is built near the top of the peak for the convenience of mountaineers has been named in memory of the ascent by the Empress, \'\' Elizabeth\'s Rest "" ; and the highest peak of all, which the Emperor alone ascended, has since then been given the name of "" Francis Joseph\'s Height."" The party returned to Heiligenblut at one o\'clock. Up to the time of her death the Empress took pleasure in referring to this excursion of her youth. After this the Empress travelled to Marburg and The Empress as a Traveller 213 Graz ; hence they undertook a journey to Venice and Milan, where their reception was so hearty and spon- taneous that the F,mperor exclaimed, ""This wipes out the memories of 1 848 ! "" and, turning to his wife, said, "" Your charms have done more to win these people than all the bayonets and cannon of my armies."" Again they undertook a journey through Hungary, which lasted fully four months. Unfortunately the 214 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria health of the Empress suffered at that time, and it was decided in i860 that she should go to Madeira and spend a winter there. Queen Victoria ofi^ered to lend her one of the royal yachts, the Empress not possessing one at that time, and Elizabeth made her first journey to Madeira on board the Victoria and Albert. The warm climate of the South soon restored her health, and she returned on the 24th of May, 1861, quite well and strong ; but in June of the same year she had a relapse, and therefore left Vienna on the 20th of that month, and sojourned at Miramare, near Trieste, whence she went to Corfu, where she stayed for some time. She returned via Venice, went to Reichenau, and from there to Kissingen, where she remained until the end of August 1862. I have already mentioned that she made Corfu her home for some months during every year, and from that place she made various excursions in her yacht, the Miramare. In 1880 she undertook a more extended journey to the Orient, and remained for some time at Zante. It is told that, when on a pedestrian expedition to a villa which was not far from that town, she met an old peasant woman, who was the caretaker of the mansion, and was living in a small, poorly furnished hut near by. The Empress entered the humble abode, to the great surprise of the old woman, who told Her Majesty that she was The Empress as a Traveller 2 1 5 sorry she could not show her over the villa, as the owners were absent and had taken away the keys, hut she begged that the lady would accept a glass of fresh water from the sparkling spring of the neighbourhood. The Empress accepted with thanks. When she had 21 6 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria entered the hut, she noticed a poor crippled boy — the only living being the peasant woman had to bestow her love and care upon — endeavouring to leave the only room in the cottage for the open air ; his position touched Her Majesty\'s sympathy, and she immediately gave the woman a princely present of money, in order that she might be able to take better care of the child. When the poor mother saw the gold pieces, she must have guessed who her visitor was, for she fell upon her knees and kissed the hem of her dress, overcome by gratitude and joy. The companions of Her Majesty, who had been witnesses of this deed of kindness, were deeply touched by. the pathetic scene enacted before them. During this journey she also visited Troja ; and it may be remarked here that the Empress was the first European sovereign who did not mind the difficulties and fatigue which had to be endured in order to visit this historically celebrated spot. On that occasion some of the Turkish guards who accompanied the caravan were about to shoot some of the wild geese which were found there in large quantities, thinking that the sport would give Her Majesty pleasure ; but she forbade them ; she did not approve of such cruelty, and opposed the wanton killing of harmless animals merely for the sake of personal gratification. In 1887 the Empress visited England. She stay td The Empress as a Traveller 217 for some time in the Isle of Wight, having taken Steephill Castle, and afterwards in Norfolk. Her repeated visits to England and Ireland in 1879-82 I have touched upon in another chapter. Very frequent were her tours through Bavaria and 21 8 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria various parts of the Salzkammergut, and her favourite spots for sojourning at were Feldafing in Bavaria, Wiesbaden, Kissingen, and Ischl, where she held Court for many years during the summer pionths, and whence she ascended the renowned mountain of that neigh- bourhood, called "" Schaf berg.** All these places, however, she visited more rarely every year, and even at the imperial castles she only remained a short time. During the last few -years of her life she visited Biarritz and the Riviera very frequently, always travel- ling under the name of the Countess of Hohenembs, an incognito which was generally respected by the people with whom she came into contact. When at Cap Martin she rose at a time when nobody stirred at the hotel, when the birds in the trees and bushes round the hostelry commenced to sing their morning songs, when the sun had hardly begun to kiss the blue ocean out of its nightly slumber. She used to leave the hotel accompanied only by a lady-in-waiting, to make a long tour on foot in the neighbouring mountains, from which she hardly ever returned before noon to her breakfast. One morning, only two years ago, while staying at this place, she surprised the visitors at Monte Carlo by appearing amongst them in pedestrian attire, attended by a lady-in-waiting and a chamberlain : upon her return to her hotel at Cap Martin for breakfast, she had walked a distance of sixteen miles ! The Empress as a Traveller 219 She was always dressed in simple black, with a large dark straw hat upon her head, a sunshade and a fan in her hands. Her romantic and poetic nature enabled her to sec in every small flower a rich treasure ot beauty. The Empress Elizabeth was essentially a lover of nature, and found both joy and grief in the contemplation of her charming surroundings. She loved to rest at great heights, dreaming, meditating, and trying to forget the woe which was gnawing at her heart. Here she loved especially to read her favourite poets, and here she felt in close communion with them. 220 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria For some time she was accompanied on her mountain expeditions by the Jittle Archduchess Valerie, and her sister, the Countess of Trani. In 1883 she resided for sometime in Baden-Baden, and in the same year she came to Styriafor the autumn. Here it was that she almost lost her life by an accident during one of her excursions. She was riding over a wooden bridge which spanned a deep ravine, called "" The Dead Woman "" ; she had got half-way across, when the horse stumbled, both forelegs slipping through a hole in the bridge. The situation was a most dangerous one, but eventually the Empress succeeded in jumping off her hors2, pulling it out, and regaining her saddle once more. It certainly seemed that, ever after her great grief in 1889, the Empress was possessed almost of a mania to rush from place to place, getting tired of one as soon as she had settled there, and ever seeking fresh scenes : at one time it was her palace in Corfu, then some watering-place in Germany, a large hotel on the Riviera, a lonely chateau, and again a crowded hostelry, in Switzerland. She was a familiar figure in nearly every one of those Baths in the centre of Europe in which women especially seek relief and deliverance from the miseries of diseased bodies and diseased minds. Kreuznach, a beautiful little town in a valley only half an hour\'s railway journey from Bingen-on-the- The Empress as a Traveller 221 Rhine, is a favourite place for women, and is supposed to alleviate, their manifold troubles. This resort was visited by the Empress, and her habits there were as peculiar as elsewhere. She would get up about four o\'clock in the morning, and by six had completed that two hours\' walk before breakfast which is part of the 222 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria cure. Early as the people of Kreuznach were, there was nobody about at that hour in the morning. The next walk was between nine and eleven — again a time when few were about, as most of the patients were then either at their breakfasts or in their baths. The Empress did not care to be seen by anybody ; she shrank from the vulgar and embarrassing stare to which royalty is generally subjected. At Territet in Switzerland, which was also a favourite resort, she followed similar habits ; there she used to take her bath punctually at five o\'clock every morning ; then she sat on the terrace until eight o\'clock, when she was served with a breakfast of iced milk and biscuits ; and during the rest of the day she would roam about, dressed in black, with short sleeves, a short skirt, and tan boots. She hardly ever wore gloves, and when passing any one she invariably covered her face with a fan. On returning to her apartments, which were extremely simple, she would respond to the respectful salutes of her suite w^jth a gentle wave of her hand. She always retired to rest very early. At Kissingen in Bavaria, where she stayed as late as April of this year (1898) — a time before the season had begun, and when therefore few people were about — she walked a good deal, usually alone, and sometimes she would even enter the shops and buy a great many articles that attracted her fancy ; generally, however. t \' - c ■^•>\'\\\\ .^\' * V !•• . TC.H, V - "". —••• -*■ 4h The Empress as a Traveller 225 she allowed this to be done by her ladies-in-waiting. Some people who saw her then state that there were still traces of the dazzling beauty of countenance which she once possessed, and that she preserved much of the unquestionable grace of her figure. Of late years she travelled with only two ladies-in- waiting and one chamberlain in attendance, and her suite was therefore very limited. During this year (i 898) she had accidentally seen some photographs of the Dolomite region in the Tyrol, and was informed that an hotel had been built in those mountain fastnesses near the Karer See, right under the hill of the "" Rosen Garten,"" not far from the Rothwand. This renowned district receives its name from the enormous quantity of rhododendrons which grow there, and also from the lovely pink colour of the mountains, which seem to glow into a fiery red at the rising and setting of the sun. It was soon after Her Majesty had become acquainted with this region that she made her appearance at the Karer See Hotel, and occupied rooms there for some weeks, making extensive excursions in all directions ; and there are few peaks in the neighbourhood which the Empress did not ascend. She seemed on all her journeys to be at war with the police authorities, as it was most uncongenial to her to be watched and guarded by detectives, and she would 15 226 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria frequently go so far as to give false information as to her intended journeys. Paris the Empress visited frequently, but never in an official manner. She was expected to go there in state during the time of the Empire, shortly after the famous interview between Napoleon III. and the Emperor Francis Joseph and herself and Eugenie in 1869; yet for some reason or other she did not do so. But the imperial lady often came to Paris in a quiet, unostenta- tious manner, and usually took many rides in the Bois de Boulogne, and did extensive shopping in the Rue de la Paix or on the Boulevards. Early in 1898, before starting for her villa at Cap Martin, she stayed in Paris in the Hotel Dominici with the Countess of Trani. This was for the purpose of being able to visit the sinister spot in the Rue Jean-Goujon, where her youngest sister, the Duchesse d\'Alen^on, perished in the flames at the Charity Bazaar. Later on she intended to go to M. Morot\'s studio, in order to see the portrait of the Duchesse, but a violent attack of neuralgia obliged her to hasten her departure for the South. The Empress of Austria was well known at Amsterdam and The Hague, where she was considered somewhat eccentric. She was accustomed to walk about the capital alone and unattended. Once, as she was promenading with a large yellow fan before her 4 \\ \\ •-1 The Empress as a Traveller 229 face, a jocular passer-by snatched away her fan and cried, ""Come, let us look at your face."" Much diplomatic commotion resulted from this incident. Favourite journeys of Her Majesty were those to Greece and Northern Africa and the Adriatic Littoral, where she was generally accompanied by her youngest daughter. During her sojourn at Algiers she paid a visit to the old capital of Tlemczen and made many excur- sions to Staiieli, the great Trappist establishment, and watched with the greatest interest the making of scent from rose geraniums, with which the monks are principally occupied. Here again she left a large money present for the benefit of the institution, having ascertained that many of the poor of the neighbour- hood are fed and taken care of there. But it was not only in foreign lands that she enjoyed these long excursions ; both at Vienna and at Buda-Pesth she used daily to drive out for some miles, and then leave her carriage and walk along lonesome wood-paths ; and the people who met her had no idea that this slim figure in black, walking so unostentatiously, accompanied only by one lady, was their Empress. The neighbourhood of Buda-Pesth has hardly a spot where the Hungarian Queen has not been. In October 1897 she spent a few weeks there attended by Fraulein von Ferenczij, her reader, and visited 230 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria the celebrated grave of Gul Babas, the Mohammedan saint. Architect Wagner, the owner of the adjacent villa, accompanied the Empress, and explained to her the various remarkable points of the tomb. Indeed, there was nothing which would not awaken the interest of this traveller. It was a strange feature in her character that she loved to be alone, and would even prefer to dispense with her lady-in-waiting and chamberlain. Only two years ago, when sojourning in Biarritz, she gave no little trouble to the Spanish Government by her frequent long excursions on foot across the French frontier without any male companions, as special precautions had to be taken for her safety, brigands not having yet entirely disappeared from that district. The difficulties of those who were told ofF for her protection were by no means insignificant. For instance, the Empress Elizabeth, when in Paris, would often rise .before five o\'clock in the morning, and start for the Bois de Boulogne or elsewhere on foot or on horseback, and the detectives, who had been on duty around her temporary domicile all night, were compelled to follow as fast as they could. One of the police commissaries who looked after the Empress at Vichy states that, whilst she was kind- ness and amiability personified, she was incredibly The Empress as a Traveller 233 imprudent, and often rather querulous about the measures taken for her security, in spite of the utmost tact and discretion on the part of those directed to watch over her. One day the Empress, while climbing the hills round Mentone, was suddenly frightened by the hang- dog appearance of a long-haired shepherd, and she was then rather glad to find herself protected. How- ever, she very soon forgot this incident, and again asked for the suspension of all supervision. The detective, in reply to this request, explained that he was obliged to do his duty, and that he was moreover on the look-out for a suspicious character from the Danubian principalities, who was expected to arrive in the neighbourhood at the same time as the Emperor Francis Joseph ; so at last she acquiesced in the arrangements. In the Tyrol she took up her abode principally in Meran, where she was joined by other members of the imperial family, and where also her brother the Duke Charles Theodore with his family owns a villa, which they occupy during the winter months. There the guide Buchensteiner won the special confidence of the Empress, not so much on account of his thorough acquaintance with the mountains, as because he under- stood her so well, and knew how to keep back the curious crowds who were anxious to see her. 234 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria In 1889, in spite of the unfavourable weather, she made some long excursions, and showed herself on these occasions a splendid pedestrian. Even in climbing the steepest hills upon bad roads she did not show any fatigue ; in fact, it was sometimes difficult for her suite to follow her ; and it was on that account perhaps that she undertook a great many expeditions lasting the whole day accompanied only by Buchensteiner, who used to carry a satchel containing some dainties and some milk, which would comprise Her Majesty\'s luncheon. This guide knew all the best spots from which fine views could be obtained, and there the imperial lady used to take a seat upon a stone or a stump of a tree, and look out on the beautiful scenery for hours and hours without one word being spoken. I had occasion a short time ago to have a con- versation with Buchensteiner, who said most charac- teristically : "" When I take persons up in these mountains, I often marvel what they want up here ; they do not seem to care for the view, they do not love the flowers or take any interest in anything — all they want is to be able to say they have been on the top of that peak. How different it is with the Empress ; she overlooks nothing, — every stone, the most in- significant plant or flower, she observes ; the most common bird, even a butterfly, seems to afl^ord her pleasure ; and when she comes to a spot whence she The Empress as a Traveller 235 can look upon the beautiful expanse of scenery below, I have seen tears in her eyes, and a saintly look come over her as she gazed toward the blue sky, as if she were thanking her Creator for having accorded her this happiness."" When the Empress was at Meran last autumn (1897), and had taken rooms at the Hotel Kaiserhof, Buchensteiner was immediately commanded to wait upon her. Here is an episode which may find a place in this chapter. The Empress Elizabeth had expressed a wish to arrive at Meran entirely incognito. However, her arrival, in spite of precautions, had become known on the same day. To the many enquirers at the hotel as to what time she would arrive it was answered, \'*At seven o\'clock in the evening."" An enormous mass of people crowded the approaches to the railway station and the Hotel Kaiserhof at that time, when a lady, in simple black dress, with a stick in her hand, walked unobserved along the street, and entered the hotel from a side door ; it was the Empress, who had arrived many hours before, and had just returned from a mountain excursion of which not a soul knew anything. How- ever, the wish of Her Majesty to be left alone was fully respected by the natives, and it was only the foreigners who, without any consideration, almost mobbed her when she went out in the daytime. 236 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria On the 2nd of November, 1897, the Empress visited the tomb of the Habsburgs at the Church of the Capuchins in Vienna, and prayed for some time beside the coffin of her never-to-be-forgotten son, the late Crown Prince Rudolf ; and shortly afterwards she left the capital for Biarritz, where she remained until the 1 8th of December, 1897 ; and then went for a sojourn of some days to Paris, where she underwent a course of massage on account of slight rheumatism in one of her feet. She spent Christmas in the French capital, and was seen on various occasions walking along the gay Boulevards with her sister. On the 29th of December she arrived at Marseilles, where her yacht the Miramare awaited her, and in company with the Countess Trani she sailed for San Remo. There she remained with her sister up to the ist of March, 1898, and then went to Turin, where she again remained for a couple of days, and thence to Territet. On the 1 8th of April Her Majesty went to Kissingen, where the Emperor visited her on the 25th of the same month, coming from Dresden, where he had been the guest of King Albert of Saxony for the celebration of that personage\'s seventieth birthday. The Empress remained at Kissingen until the 8th of May, and journeyed thence to Briickenau, to drink the waters. Her sojourn there lasted a month. On the 13th of June she returned to Vienna, and was ^ The Empress as a Traveller 239 there received by her husband at the railway station, with whom she drove to her private castle of Lainz, where she remained until the 2nd of July, on which day she journeyed with the Emperor to IschI, accompanied by her daughter Marie Valerie and her husband and children. It was also on that day that it was officially made known that the health of the Empress was such as to give cause for serious uneasiness, and that it would be necessary for her to spend the following winter in a southern climate. The official notice stated that the Empress was suffering from anaemia, nervousness, and insomnia, and that the diagnosis had shown a slight enlargement of the heart. Her physicians had advised her to go to Bad Nauheim ; and on the i6th of July, accompanied by her lady-in-waiting the Countess Sztaray and her personal medical attendant Dr. Kerzl, she arrived at that watering-place in Hesse, and took apartments at the Villa Kracht, placing herself under Dr. Theodore Schott, of whom I have already spoken. Her recovery was most remarkable, due partly no doubt to the fact that the visitors fully respected the Empress\'s desire for quietness and solitude. On the 2nd of August she received the Empress Frederick, who came from Kronberg, and the inter- view lasted for more than half an hour, during which the most animated conversation was sustained. On the 23rd of August she met the Emperor 240 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria William II. and his wife ; and besides these the young Grand Duke of Hesse, and his charming spouse, the grand-daughter of our Queen, paid their respects ta Elizabeth. So much better did Her Majesty feel, that there remained little doubt that her full recovery was assured, and that it would only be a question of time. She was advised to spend some time in mountain air in order to recoup her strength, and it was on this account that she went to Switzerland and returned to Territet, where she had already spent March and April. She arrived at that ""beautiful mountain resort on the 29th of August, and stayed at the Hotel Caux, near Glion. Here she intended to remain for some weeks before returning to join her husband in Vienna, during the festivities which were in preparation for the Jubilee of his reign. She had just returned from a visit to the .Baroness Rothschild at her charming villa, and was on her way back from Geneva to Caux, when she was assassinated. Dr. Christomanos, formerly reader to the late Empress, speaking of her many journeys, tells us of the following remarks she made to him some time ago : "" I prefer travelling in the night, as then the illusion is greater — otherwise one must struggle with the hours before one reaches one\'s goal."" When he once observed to his imperial mistress that it is said ^ The Empress as a Traveller 243 monarchs do not know the value of money, the Empress Elizabeth replied that she valued money as only, in her eyes, it should be valued — viz. according to the intensity of the wishes it gratified. ""All things,"" she said, \'\'should be paid for according to their worth to us individually. There is nothing of absolute value around us. I would give more for a book that I wanted and for a flower high up in a hedge than for a house or a journey in Algeria."" Whilst in a Kabyle village the Empress saw a white figure suddenly appear out of the darkness. It followed her, dodging about behind trunks of trees. "" I recommended Her Majesty to return,"" says Dr. Christomanos. "" She refused, saying, * No ! the Arab would think we feared him. We might give him in this way bad thoughts. One should never stand in the way of one\'s destiny.\' The same instant the Kabyle stood before us, his manner being very threatening. The Empress did not for one moment lose her presence of mind. She said, \' That is a madman. We must hasten away ; such people are more dangerous than criminals."" On travelling through Venice the Empress remarked sadly, "" The Emperor still speaks good Italian ; that is all that is left of our kingdom — more than we need. I was also obliged to learn Italian, but I could not 244 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria reconcile myself to this tongue, and all the trouble would have been thrown away."" Her Majesty travelled generally with a very limited suite, and had an allowance of about ^5,000 per month for the purpose. After what has been said it is not difficult to judge how much of this sum went into the pockets of the needy. CHAPTER IX. THE EMPRESS ELIZABETH AND KING LUDWIG II. OF BA VARIA. \\ 245 CHAPTER IX. THE EMPRESS ELIZABETH AND KING LUDWIG //. OF BAVARIA. CONSIDERING the very extraordinary behaviour of the late Bavarian King Ludwig II. towards the lady to whom he was betrothed, and who was the youngest sister of the Empress Elizabeth, it strikes one as strange to find that an almost romantic friend- ship existed between him and the consort of Francis Joseph, which lasted to the very days which preceded the King\'s deposition and his tragic suicide. The engagement of Princess Sophie of Bavaria with the King was popular, the more so because it was well known that the couple loved each other, and that the affair was not the outcome of diplomatic or political negotiations — the marriage would be a love match pure and simple. The sudden breaking ofi^ of the engagement without an explanation or even an apology ended the friendship existing between the parents of his intended bride and the King ; but how- ever strained the relations between them, it did not 247 ^48 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria prevent the Empress Elizabeth from maintaining the most intimate friendship with the King, which was quite characteristic of her, as she never allowed her- self to be guided by circumstances, and always acted upon her feelings, regardless of what others thought. That a relationship between such a poetry-loving sovereign as the King of Bavaria and an idealist like the Empress should have been most romantic seems but natural. There is almost in the middle of the Lake of Starenberg, on the shores of which Possenhofen and the Castle of Berg are situated, an island, which, from the magnificent rose gardens which a former king had planted thereon, has received the name of "" Rosen- Insel "" (Isle of Roses). The island is reputed to have possessed in the most ancient times a heathen temple, which was later on converted into a Catholic chapel, and even at the present time Roman coins, vessels, and ornaments are found there. The gardens, which were first laid out by King Max, were greatly beautified by his son Ludwig II., whose love for all that was beautiful is so well known. It is said that there were sixteen thousand plants of this queen of flowers, and the scent was so strong that it could be perceived miles out on the lake. In the midst of these labyrinths of roses there stood a villa, called "" Die Ermitage,\'* the only dwelling on the islet, with the exception of a The EmfM-ess and Ludwig II. of Bavaria 249 small cottage for the gardener\'s use. High hedges, formed of trees and bushes, surrounded the whole island so thoroughly that it was impossible to get even a glimpse of the gardens when passing in the boats ; it was almost impossible to perceive the small jettyjh built for the landing of the King from his steam yacht Tristan. ^5^ Elizabeth^ Empress o( Austria In this small villa, built in the Italian style, which comprised only a very few rooms, Ludwig II. spent some of his most happy and quiet days ; here he collected his favourite poets, and here he dreamt and meditated, and here he had his special rendezvous with the Empress Elizabeth of Austria, who, when on her yearly visit to her parents\' Castle of Possenhofen, would meet the youthful monarch, and together they would indulge themselves undisturbed in conversation congenial to their tastes. From the upper storey of the building one of the finest of views can be obtained over the deep blue lake and the purple mountains which stretch as far as the eye can reach. To describe the gardens themselves would be almost an impossibility : the endeavours of two kings resulted in a collection of the finest specimens of roses known to the world ; and their rich colours — white, yellow, and all shades of red, from the lightest pink to the darkest crimson — formed a lovely relief after the pure blue of the waters. In the last year of his life King Ludwig visited the island rarely, and only when he knew that the Empress was staying at Possenhofen. It was so arranged that the two exalted personages should come to the islet at a given hour ; but if anything happened to prevent their meeting, the one who had arrived would write a letter and place the same in a special The Empress and Ludwig IL o( Bavaria 251 drawer of a writing-table of which only their two Majesties had keys, and so they were able without the intervention of a third person to communicate with each other when a personal interview was impracticable. After the death of Ludwig II. the villa upon the Isle of Roses was visited by the commissioner who had charge of the affairs of the departed monarch, and in the writing-table in question there was still found a letter, which had the following address : ""The Dove to the Eagle."" It transpired that these were the appellations used in their romantic intercourse, the Empress being the Dove and the King the Eagle. Even at a time when Ludwig would not sufFer a single soul to be near him, when his passion for soli- tude had almost become a mental disease, he was ever ready to receive his cousin^ and was happy to spend some time with her in conversation. There existed without doubt a great affinity between them, and it was often remarked that no one but the Empress appeared to understand the fantastic King, and the similarity of their ideas, tastes, and pleasures was strongly and frequently in evidence. How much the imperial lady sympathised with the unfortunate King, how deeply she felt his deposition and his tragic end, can only be conjectured ; but the fact that she retired imme- diately upon hearing of the catastrophe to one of her castles, in order to be able to give herself up completely 2 $2 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria to the grief which the tragedy had caused her, says much. For may weeks she mourned in solitude at the Achilleon. The intimate and friendly relationship between the two was openly recognised at the lying in state of King Ludwig at the royal residence in Munich. Surrounded by the pomp displayed on such occasions by the Roman Church, combined with that prescribed by royal courts, the body lay upon a cata- falque of sombre velvet, wrapped in a gorgeous purple mantle belonging to the order of St. Hubertus. Tall silver candelabra, holding burning wax tapers, stood in double rows at the side of the bier ; next to this there were beds of flowers, formed by the many tokens of love and grief sent from all parts of the world ; but there was only one floral tribute nestling upon the breast of the departed King — a simple spray of jessamine, the last gift the Empress of Austria made to her friend and kinsman Ludwig. More than once after his death did the royal lady visit the spot where the King lost his life, and she herself took great interest in the memorial chapel which is to be erected there. When visiting Possenhofen, she never neglected to make a pilgrimage to the Castle of Berg, or to pray at the spot where the unhappy high-minded Ludwig ended the life which had become intolerable to him. The Empress and Ludwig IL of Bavaria 253 The Emperor, the Crown Prince Rudolf, and his sister the Princess Leopold of Bavaria were all admitted to the friendship of the eccentric King, and Francis Joseph was fully aware of the great sympathy which existed between his wife and Ludwig. It is reported that the Empress most strongly opposed the deposition of her late friend, and had actually prevailed upon the Emperor to promise to frustrate it, or at least to make it only temporary ; the premature death of the unfortunate monarch, however, put an end to the matter. CHAPTER X. MATER DOLOROSA. aS5 CHAPTER X. MATER DOLOROSA, "" But the whole life of man is full of grief, Nor is there rest from toils."" Euripides, A HIGHLY sensitive nature feels most acutely the ordinary troubles and worries of life ; and how terrible must be the suffering of the senti- mentalists with strongly sympathetic hearts, when they are allotted more than the common share of its bitterness ! The Empress Elizabeth of Austria was one of those, one may well say, unfortunate beings for whom the Germans have so perfect an expression, which we lack in our own language — vi%. Gefiihlsmensch ("" sentimentalist "" — although this term by no means expresses exactly what is meant by the German appellation). She suffered intensely not merely the ordinary vexations which form part of every one\'s life, but she felt also the pain of others as though it had been her own. 257 17 2 $9 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria When we consider the unusually large number of misfortunes and awful catastrophes which were crowded into her life, we shall experience no difficulty in understanding the vehement grief and sorrow which the sorely afflicted woman suffered for so many years. Nor can we feel surprised that on the blotter generally used by the Empress were written Byron\'s true words : — "" Count o\'er the joys thine hours have seen, Count o\'er the days from anguish free, And know, whatever thou hast been, Tis something better not to be ! "" Early in her married life (1857) she had to mourn the death of her first-born, Princess Sophie. The imperial couple had undertaken a tour through Hungary. The Empress, in fulness of love for her children, could not separate herself from her two little daughters, and it was therefore decided that they should travel with their parents. To guard against bad water on the journey, bottles, filled with wholesome spring water from Schonbrunn, were carried in the imperial train, and placed in ice, in order to be kept fresh and cool. However, from some unexplained reason, the water decomposed, and the child Princess, attacked by typhus, succumbed to this terrible scourge after a few days\' illness. Mater Dolorosa 259 In 1859 the Empress again passed through a time of great anxiety, her gallant husband being with his army in Italy, fighting in defence of his realm against the allied armies of France and Italy. The disasters of Montebello, Magenta, and Solferino pro- duced unspeakable anguish in the sensitive heart of Elizabeth. A few years afterwards she wept over the body of a beloved cousin — the young daughter of the Archduke Albert, commander-in-chief of the Austrian armies, and hero of many battles — who, when on the point of becoming the wife of the Crown Prince of Italy, had met a terrible death by burning in her father\'s palace in Vienna, through setting fire to her light summer attire. That the morganatic marriage of her eldest brother with Fraulein Mendle, an actress of Munich, also caused the Empress great grief is certain, for she was warmly attached to him; and as she could not entirely dis- approve of a match founded on such a romantic love, she especially felt his being obliged to resign all his rights and privileges on account of his matrimonial arrangement. The number of morganatic marriages contracted by her near relatives was extraordinary, and the Empress felt the many shocks her proud husband experienced by the actions of the imperial archdukes no less strongly than the mesalliances of her own family. The 26o Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Archduke Henry married Mdlle. Leopoldine Hofmann, who sang in the theatre of Graz, Styria. But long before him the Archduke John, brother of the Emperor Francis II. and great-uncle of Francis Joseph, had set an example of this new departure in the imperial house by marrying a peasant. The story is quite romantic. One day he arrived at the post-station of Brandhofen ; the postmaster was greatly embarrassed, for he found all his postilions (the name given to the drivers of the diligences) absent, and was unable to supply one for His Imperial Highness, who was anxious to continue his journey at once. The postmaster\'s daughter, Fraulein Anna Plochel, conceived at once the idea of disguising herself as a postilion and driving the Prince ; on the way he detected this disguise, became fascinated with her youthful beauty and the pluck she displayed, and ere many months had passed married her. She was created a Baroness of Brandhofen, and later Countess of Meran ; and her only son is now the Count of Meran, and still lives in Styria. But the saddest episode in the chapter of mesalliances is that known as the mystery of Johann Orth, one of the most remarkable romances in the dynastic history of Europe in this century. The Archduke John Salvator of Tuscany, and a nephew of the Emperor Francis Joseph, had fallen in love with an opera-singer, whom he married in spite of all family opposition. Mater Dolorosa 261 renouncing at the same time all his rights, privileges, and rank, and assuming the name of Orth, after one of his castles. The romantic marriage was celebrated secretly, but in a perfectly legal manner, by the Registrar of Islington, and countersigned by the Austrian Consul-General in London. Johann Orth next bought in Liverpool a fine ship, which he re- christened the Santa Margarita^ after his wife ; and so anxious was he to guard against the vessel being recognised, that he stipulated that all drawings and photographs of it should be handed over to him, and these he burned with his own hands ; moreover, he caused all portraits and negatives of himself and of his wife to be bought up at any price, and these were likewise destroyed. I am giving here only abso- lute facts. Shortly afterwards he set sail with his wife for South America, and the vessel was duly reported to have arrived at Monte Video and departed for a destination unknown. But from that moment every trace was lost of the ship and all on board ; not a scrap of any sort of news as to her fate has ever been recovered, although many a search has been made along the coast by order of the Emperor of Austria and his Government. Adventurers, treasure-seekers too, have been at work, as it was well known that the Archduke had on board over a quarter of a million pounds in gold ; it is 262 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria believed that he intended to have bought an estate in Chile with the money and to have settled there, but that the vessel foundered ofF Cape Horn during a terrific storm which raged on the coast shortly after the ship left. From time to time since then the most startling rumours have been published about the missing Arch- duke having turned up : one being that he had been one of the leaders of the Chilian rebellion, having divided his treasure among his crew, burned his ship, landed on a lonely coast, and made his way to Chile ; another that he was the famous marshal who fought in China ; a third story tells that the eccentric Prince is still alive, and secretly corresponded with his mother until her death quite recently ; but no doubt the truth is that the Santa Margarita lies at the bottom of the sea, and that all on board perished. Again was the life of Her Majesty saddened by the disastrous events in Bohemia in 1866, followed in 1867 by the appalling catastrophe at Queretaro, where a brother of Francis Joseph, who had accepted the crown of Mexico, was executed as a traitor. The horror of the event was heightened by the fact that the wife of the ill-fated sovereign, who had returned to Austria in order to seek succour for the hard-pressed Emperor, lost her reason on hearing of her husband\'s death, and that at the very moment he was being led forth to execution on the Mater Dolorosa 263 ■ other side of the world his brother Francis Joseph was being proclaimed under circumstances of unpre- cedented splendour King ot the Magyars on this. The unfortunate lady has lived for twenty-nine years at the Castle of La^ken, near Brussels, where she finds r 264 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria her only solace in music. She is a sister of the King of the Belgians, and was born in 1840, and married when only seventeen years of age. Elizabeth was a most kind friend to her sister-in-law, and visited her frequently whenever she was in a fit state to receive her : no journey was ever too long for her late Majesty when she felt that she could alleviate the suflferings of others. Before I reach the climax of the Empress\'s suffer- ings, which brought about such a terrible change in her whole life, and from the shock of which she never fully recovered, I may again refer to the death of Ludwig II. of Bavaria in 1887, which was a source of such genuine grief to her. Strongly, too, did she feel for her sister the Countess of Trani, who was left a widow by the suicide of her husband in a fit of temporary insanity. The sad experiences of another of her sisters, the ex-Queen of Naples, she followed with her sympathetic heart, and mourned with her the loss of her throne ; and only a few years ago her tears were again shed in sorrow at the terrible disaster which befell her youngest sister, the Duchesse d\'Alen^on, who in trying to save the lives of her young companions sacrificed her own in the appalling fire at the Charity Bazaar in Paris. The extent of the Empress\'s sympathies will be understood when it is mentioned that she suffered Mater Dolorosa 265 intense grief over the death of the Duke of Albany, whom she had on various occa- sions met in Vienna and England ; and that she felt the sad decease of the Duke of Clarence on the eve of his intended marriage with the Princess Mary of Teck so strongly that she was obliged to with- draw for a few days entirely from inter- course with even her nearest relatives. Al- ways of a romantic nature, it was natural , , . Ill """"\'^ \'-*TE 0UCHES3E n\'ALENfON, SISTER that this melancholy of the empress. event should have made a particularly strong impression upon her, the more so as it followed so quickly the death of her own son, at which the young Duke had displayed so much grief Those who have suffered can best understand the 266 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria feelings of grief in others, and it was for this reason that the Empress was so intensely sympathetic with the Prince and Princess of Wales, for whom she entertained a great regard ; in fact, close bonds of friendship existed between them. I retain a vivid picture in my mind of the Empress walking side by side with the Princess of Wales down the carpeted platform of Edge Hill Station when the royal party alighted from a special train. Elizabeth had been paying a visit to. Liverpool, and incidentally to the delightful seat of Lord Sefton. They were a pair of regal beauties, and so remarkably alike in carriage, stature, and pose of head as to make the mistake of thinking them sisters quite pardonable ; the only difference was that the Empress had a slightly firmer step than the Princess, and displayed more strength in the chest and shoulders. The Empress at that time was lithe and graceful in every movement, and alighted from the railway carriage with the activity of a girl of eighteen, rather than with the cautious step of a woman of forty-six, as she then was. It caused the Empress great distress to hear of the death of the young Prince Imperial, the son of Napoleon and Eugenie ; and her mother\'s heart went out in its fulness towards the lonely woman who once wore a crown and is now an exile in foreign lands. Shocked and grieved, too, was she Mater Dolorosa 267 over the murders of Lincoln, Garfield, and Carnot ; in fact, no tragedy could pass without exciting in her sympathetic sorrow and grief. And lastly I must mention the great disappointment caused her by the elopement of her grand-daughter with a young Protestant officer. One might feel induced to ask if anything could be added to such a list of misfortunes beating upon a woman who ever strove to do her duty and to alleviate the sufferings of others, and it is sad to say that this question has to be answered with a most emphatic "" Yes."" The thirtieth day of the month of January 1889 brought upon the poor mother a disaster which may well be said to stand unique in this century. It is a strange coincidence that this day also is the anniversary of the execution of King Charles I., one of Prince Rudolf\'s ancestors. The Crown Prince Rudolf, who was the only son of Francis Joseph and Elizabeth, was at the date mentioned thirty years of age. He was spending some days at the Castle of Mayerling, his shooting- box, not far from Vienna, with a small suite and a few friends. On the evening of the day above referred to he was seen for some time in his box at the opera- house; thence he drove to his country seat, and on the last day of the month Europe was shocked by the news that the youthful Prince had died a violent death, 268 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Many were the rumours accounting for this terrible tragedy ; it is doubtful whether the whole truth will ever be known ; and whether his death was caused by his own hand, or by the hand of another, is still an open question. What is known is that the Crown Prince was found dead with a terrible wound in his head in the early hours of the 3 ist of January, lying upon his bed ; it appeared that the skull had been broken either by a stroke with some blunt instrument or by a pistol ball. In the castle there was also discovered the body of a young lady, the BaronessWetsceraAkiUed by a revolver shot. It was suggested that the unhappy Rudolf had committed suicide, but indications (the state of the wound itself) led strongly to a different surmise. However, of the two most generally accepted theories, one made the tragedy a case of double suicide, the other attributed it to the vengeance of a relation of the young Baroness, who, unable to challenge the Prince, killed him and shot also his paramour. What this tragedy must have been to his mother it is impossible to tell. In the splendid isolation of thrones family ties are exceptionally close and tender, because sovereigns can hardly have friends. We know that here in England the death of Lady Augusta Stanley, the wife of the late Dean of West- minster, not a relation, but only a friend of our Queen, affected her almost as much as the loss of her husband. Mater Dolorosa 269 because Lady Augusta had been long about her person. The loss to a sovereign of a near relation, one of the few persons who can speak freely, must be great. But what must it have been to the Empress of Austria, already burdened by more than her full ^70 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria measure of misfortunes, in poor health, and of an exceptionally nervous temperament, to lose her son — her only son — whom she loved with all the intense love of which a mother is capable? Her heroism on that occasion was extraordinary. She undertook herself the sad duty of informing the Emperor of the terrible news. Although her own heart was bleeding, the sense of duty was victorious in the wife ; and the noble woman understood how to comfort her imperial spouse, and to alleviate his grief and suffering. With what intense admiration did the peoples of Austria and Hungary— nay, the whole world — look up to the exalted woman who sat upon the throne of the Austrian Empire, when, herself bowed down with unspeakable grief, she endeavoured to console and to support her husband, whose afflictions were so many and so terrible ! But from that day the Empress Elizabeth was no more what she had been ; her heart had experienced at that moment such pain that it became as dead ; she could, when it was needed, be heroic towards the Emperor, but the more terrible was the reaction which followed, and which overwhelmed the sensitive heart. A dark shadow rested upon the beautiful countenance of the Empress ; she was never known to laugh from that moment, and even her smiles became rare ; a veritable Mater Dolorosa she wandered through the Mater Dolorosa 271 wide world, finding her only consolation in doing good to others, and in making their sufferings her own. All sorrows of the past faded into insignificance beside her. suffering and agony at the sad death of the Crown Prince. It was ever said that Elizabeth and Rudolf were more like brother and sister to each other than parent and child ; and we can fully conceive how great were the pangs which rent her devoted and loving heart when she looked upon the pale face of the youthful Prince, who was the hope of her life and the centre of her wishes and expectations. The devotion of her youngest daughter, Marie Valerie, helped to assuage her grief ; but the passage of nearly ten years had not been able to bring her forgetful- ness. Never did she pass through Vienna without descending the crypt of the Church of the Capuchins, to lay a wreath on the coffin of her Rudolf — to kneel, her head resting on the silver lid, for hours in silent prayer ; and she never left the city without paying a visit to the late Prince\'s shooting-box, and remaining there in prolonged devotion in the chapel, into which the room where the terrible tragedy took place had been converted, the castle itself having been turned into a monastery. The grief of the Empress was expressed in her every action during the last nine years of her life, 272 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria and it no doubt added much to the breaking up of her health ; in fact, the wound which was inflicted upon her heart on that terrible winter night in 1889 was only healed by the assassin\'s steel on the loth of September of this year (1898). I, n CHAPTER XI Tff£ RECLUSE. 373 1 8 r I CHAPTER XL THE RECLUSE. "" To suffer, and to gain thereby A more exalted grade Among the spirits purified by pain."" Robert, Lord Lytton. THAT the Empress Elizabeth from her earliest youth loved the silence of nature, that she found happiness in wandering in the quiet arid lone- some avenues of the park that surrounded her father\'s lake-side castle, or in the vast green aisles of a mountain forest, or in sitting on a mossy bank, reading one of her favourite authors, is well known ; and when she was called upon to fill the position of mistress of the Court of Francis Joseph, although she took part in all the functions with grace and dignity, it was no secret that she would have greatly preferred to have been able to roam about alone or with her spouse, in some secluded spot where she could with him give herself up entirely and unrestrainedly to her love for the treasures offered by nature. She contrived to retire more and more from Court life, for doing which 275 276 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria her state of health gave her excuse. After the festivities in connection with her silver wedding in 1879 she every year appeared more rarely be- fore the public, and when the death of the Crown Prince happened, her love for solitude became so in- tense that soon she could only find repose "" far from the madding crowd."" Vienna saw her no more ; her short stays there were given up to visits to the coffin of her son. LATE CROWN PRINCE. Hcr pflvate rcsidcnce, the Castle\'of Lainz, which she had liked so much in former days, could not hold her for more than a week at a time : even this secluded spot was not quiet enough for her. In this strange passion we cannot fail to again trace a similarity with her kins- man Ludwig II. It may be s^d that her presence for the purpose of viewing the pageant which was arranged for the celebration of her silver wedding was actually her last public appearance. Already at the wedding The Recluse 277 of the Crown Prince Rudolf with Princess Stephanie of Belgium, which took place with great pompon the loth of May, 1 881, at Vienna, it had been noticed how very reluctantly Her Majesty showed herself to the people, and only participated in such festivities as took place in the more intimate family circle. It is true she retained her Interest in all those charitable institu- tions in the establishment of which she had assisted so successfully ; she still continued to visit regu- larly hospitals and kindred establishments, and have personal intercourse with the sufferers ; but she preferred Ischl to Vienna, and there she sought the society of peasants in preference to that of the highest classes. Ischl afforded more perfectly the quietness which she needed. Her youngest daughter had been her constant com- panion up to the time of her marriage in 1 8go, when she wedded the 278 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Archduke Francis Salvator, the wedding being by the desire of Her Majesty quietly celebrated at Ischl. Another drop of joy fell into the cup of bitterness when in 1893 her grand-daughter, Princess Augusta of Bavaria, the younger daughter of the Archduchess Gisela, married the Archduke Joseph Augustine. But no event was important enough to rouse her again from her lethargic state ; she began to shun people ; and when travelling every contrivance had to be resorted to in order to guard her from the stares of the many who found pleasure in looking upon her. So secret were her movements kept, that she had been residing for weeks at Miramare before her presence became known in Trieste, a large town situated only a few miles distant. When sailing in her yacht, she could be observed promenading the deck alone for hours and hours; not a soul was allowed to approach and disturb her. But more than anywhere else was she able to indulge in her passion for solitude when residing at her palace in Corfu. As I have already shown when describing the Achilleon in a previous chapter, her apartments there were completely isolated from any other part of the building ; she had her private entrance, and could leave or enter the palace entirely unobserved at any moment during the day or night. Her meals she took by herself, waited upon only by a lady-in-waiting and Yhe Recluse i79 one footman. She would spend a few hours during the day in the society of some of her suite, or with her teachers and readers ; but the nights were her own — then she would wander alone through the dark groves and along the gloomy walks. When every one had retired and night covered the landscape, in the subdued glimmer of the moon or the stars, the Empress was often seen entering the gardens, clad in dark, closely fitting garments, a black veil thrown over her head, as she glided along the terraces and the paths of the park, and found her way to the beautiful monument she had erected to her son Rudolf in one of the most enchanting spots of her domain. So far as it was practicable she had in reality become a recluse, and her desire to still more thoroughly bury herself in some place far from all she knew and had once loved was expressed to her intimates over and over again. When her husband visited her from time to time during her sojourns abroad, she became more animated, and seemed to be imbued with new life ; she appeared for the time being to forget her woes. But the reaction which followed such visits was very marked. When, shortly before her assassination, she was staying at Nauheim, she received, it is true, the visits of some exalted personages, as already mentioned in a previous chapter ; but the interviews were of extremely short 28o Elizabeth, Empress of Austria duration, and most of her time the afflicted Empress spent alone. In a similar way she could not be prevailed upon to accept an invitation to the Court of Queen Victoria, The Recluse 281 when, a few years ago, she was for the last time in England, but only paid Her Majesty a flying visit. This is the more remarkable when it is considered that she entertained a great love and admiration for our beloved Queen, and for the Princess of Wales and Princess Henry of Battenberg. It had almost become a disease, this intense dislike to mankind, and it caused Francis Joseph great anxiety. The tragedy of Geneva becomes the sadder when we find that her health had improved so much during her stay in Switzerland that she had commenced to enjoy again the society of others, as was shown by her visit to the Baroness Rothschild, and by her decision to return to Vienna to participate in the Jubilee festivities with the Emperor. This change was strange, as her aversion to step out of her solitude had some months previously reached such a pitch that even her meetings with her nearest relations became painful to her. Some years ago she was strongly attached to her brother Charles Theodore and his family, and she rarely missed her annual visit to his country seat, or failed to meet him at Meran, where he was in the habit of spending the winter with his family. Her niece the Duchess of Urach (who was the most studious of royal ladies, and so fond of books that it was difficult to persuade her to tear herself away from them to join in the social 282 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria distractions of her position) was especially loved by her aunt, and yet even her society had become distasteful to the Empress. In fact, she preferred to live in contemplation and in the memory of happier days alone, in solitude — a recluse. CHAPTER XII. REMINISCENCES AND ANECDOTES. 283 CHAPTER XII. REMINISCENCES AND ANECDOTES, "" ^TpHE fierce light that beats upon the throne "" 1 enables us common mortals to observe the doings of those occupying the highest positions, and, our interest in them being ever great, it so happens that we hear of innumerable tales and anecdotes, which, if not in every instance authentic, allow us neverthe- less to judge the general characteristics of those of whom they are told ; and on this account they deserve consideration. I am not in a position to vouch for the truth of every item here recorded, but I have sifted the material at hand as carefully as I could, and may at least say, "" Si non e vero ben trovatoy * Neither do I pretend to observe a chronological order in repeating them : they are given as I received them. But so much I may state, — that some of them come directly from people who have been in the entourage of the late Empress ; all from persons whose veracity ♦ "" If it is not true, it is well invented."" {285 286 Elizabeth, Empress o{ Austria I cannot doubt ; and, finally, the truth of some has been generally accepted, although I by no means place myself unreservedly upon the side of the believers — I refer more particularly to the stories which belong more or less to the occult and supernatural, but which I cannot forego repeating, for this work would appear incomplete without them, so essential have they become to the Geneva tragedy. I may begin with a tale the action of which *is laid in the first years of Her Majesty\'s married life. Accompanied by the Emperor, she visited an exhibition of modern paintings, mostly by young artists, and was requested by her husband to make some purchases, in order to encourage rising talent. It was the Emperor\'s desire that she should buy works on various subjects, but he left the choice entirely to her. In viewing the large collection she was accompanied by a lady-in- waiting, whose duty it was to mark those pictures in the catalogue which Her Majesty selected. When she had passed through various rooms, it was found that she had put the mark to about twenty or twenty- four pictures. When some weeks after those which were picked out arrived at the imperial palace, it was found that they consisted of twenty- four specimens, but instead of the expected variety of subjects they all treated of one and the same — namely, *\' horse-flesh.*\' Elizabeth had been so completely carried away by her Reminiscences and Anecdotes 287 love for horses, that every work, without exception, represented her favourite animal in one way or another, A pleasant smile was observed on the countenance of the Emperor as he inspected the selection of his youthful consort. A very unusual experience was af- forded the Empress on a visit to the renowned lunatic asylum near Vienna. Having read of some hyp- notic experiments made by a phy- sician who was well known on ac- count of various successful trials, ""^""^ emperors VOCNCEST BBOTHER, and who had suc- ceeded, in the case of a confirmed drunkard belonging to one of the best Austrian families, in inducing him by hypnotic suggestion to take the greatest dislike, even di^ust, to alcoholic drinks, and to become by his own choice a teetotaller. Her Majesty became convinced in her own mind that this extraordinary power exercised 288 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria by some individuals over others would lead to a most beneficial issue. She therefore presented herself at the asylum at a time when she understood experi- ments would be made. She followed every movement with the closest attention, and was satisfied with all she saw, although no actual practical results were derived from the trial, if we except the case of an old patient, who, when under mesmeric influence, spoke of the life of his youth, and thus enabled the authorities to identify him, which they had failed to do for more than twelve years, during which time the unfortunate man had been an inmate of the institution. The Empress repeated her visits on diflTerent occasions. Police Commissary (Inspector) Dietze, who, during some years, was employed by the French Government to superintend the arrangements made for the safety of the Empress during her sojourn in Cap Martin, tells the following characteristic story: — One day Her Majesty commanded his presence at the hotel, and requested him to discontinue the police regulations in connection with her person. M. Dietze informed the Empress that under such circumstances he should have to ask for his recall, but she begged him to remain at Mentone, and added, ""But I implore you to give your attention to the safety of my husband : his life is necessary for the weal Reminiscences and Anecdotes 289 of his subjects ; but I am only an insignificant, grief- stricken mother — nobody would care for my life. I may become the victim of an accident, but you cannot prevent a landslip when I am out on the mountains, and such accidents are the sole danger with which I am threatened ; but for Heaven\'s sake watch over the Emperor — he has a noble and good heart — his life is valuable to millions of people."" Mrs. O\'Donoghue, who knew and observed the Empress when in Ireland for the hunting season, tells some stories of those days, which are proofs of her afFability, and of the interest she took in every one who came into contact with her. She says : — "" I had the misfortune to \' stake \' my horse badly one day, and had to walk for a mile or so to Courtown, Captain Davis\'s residence in those days, close to Kil- cock Station. The Empress Elizabeth was at lunch in the hospitable dining-room of the mansion when my entry was made ; and here again the considerate Kaiserin evinced her womanliness and sympathy, just as the least pretentious of her subjects might have done. I can recollect the scene so well, — the lovely Empress * veritably \' dismounted, and not looking in the least * sewn in,\' and the ladies who were also present casting covert glances at her outer jacket, or little coat of smooth blue Melton cloth, which was laid across the back of her chair. When 19 o.go Elizabeth, Empress of Austria the time came to put it on, the Empress, helped by her courteous host, felt for some time in vain for the second armhole, and, moving her pretty hand about in search of it, said laughingly, \' How awkward I am — how very awkward ; you must excuse me ! \' ""I think it worth mentioning, as indicative of the Empress\'s regard for animals, that on one of her Cheshire days she noticed a man riding with a terrible bridle, a strong wiry * rope-bit \' attached to an ordinary snaffle ; and it must have been excessively severe, for the horse\'s mouth was bleeding at both corners. The beautiful Kaiserin\'s sensitive eyes positively dilated when she saw it, and she uttered one word, in admirable English too — namely, \' Brute ! \' *\' I must either be silent respecting some lovely traits in the Empress Elizabeth\'s character and disposition, or occasionally place my own poor personality alongside of hers, which was majestic. In short, she was a kind friend to me in those happy early days ; and when later on a lamentable accident stopped my hunting career for ever, her words of sympathy were the most tender that comforted me in my pain. I can never tell, not even to this day, why she deigned to notice me, for in truth 1 Was \' small and of no reputation,\' and was moreover the very antithesis of her beautiful and stately self. "" She was riding one day over a rather rough bit of roadway, a short cut to some covert that was to be Reminiscences and Anecdotes 291 drawn, and as the going was slow a good many among the front-rank riders took the opportunity to speak a deferential word of welcome to the beautiful woman, who certainly adopted no pre- tentious airs. Purely from ad- miration of her I longed to do the same, and my heart was thumping gainst my breast with the effbrt to summon up courage for the ordeal, when the whole cavalcade got on to a better stage of roadway, and the chance was lost. But mark what followed. The Empress, escorted by Earl Spencer — who, I am sure, must remember it — slackened rein a bit, and, glancing round, addressed a pleasant word just when I was feeling particularly small, and then for 292 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria one delicious moment I rode by her side and answered her prettily put queries respecting my experiences of Irish sport. She cared nothing to know them — how could she ? But she evidently did care that a young rider with a flushed face and eyes of eager longing had been debarred from speaking to her when evidently yearning to do so."" A story which is still well remembered in the sur- rounding country of Possenhofen refers to an incident in the girl\'s life. On the expeditions in which she often joined her father, they would sometimes take rest and refreshment in a mountaineer\'s cottage, and on various occasions provided the dance music at Kirmesses (fairs) by playing zithers, which were easily procured for them, such instruments being found in every household in the Bavarian Alps. Once when the ducal pair had succeeded in preserving their incognito, they were ofl^ered and accepted some small silver coins in recompense for their services, and these the Empress treasured highly. "" It is the only money I ever earned,"" she told a friend a few years before her death, when showing her some of her treasures. As I have had occasion to remark before, the Empress displayed great taste in her dress ; but for years she only wore black or white. Not very long ago she distributed among her intimate friends all her Court costumes and light-coloured attire ; she said pathetically on that Reminiscenc s and Anecdotes 293 occasion that she would never feel gay enough to wear bright-hued dresses again. She had caused her wedding dress to be cut up and made nnto a suit of priestly garments for a church in Buda-Pesth : it was a white brocade woven with silver threads. Her bridal wreath encircles now an embroidered picture of the Virgin Mary in the Loretto Chapel, where the Empress frequently used to attend services. Once the Empress saved the life of a poor woman in Hungary; it happened one day in November 1882, when H.r Majesty drove to the meeting of the hounds near Magyarod ; the road lay along some steep precipices by the side of the Rakos River ; suddenly the Empress ordered the carriage to stop, for she noticed an old woman close in front of her walking straight towards the side of the road where the precipice was — a declivity of some hundreds of feet. Elizabeth, fearing danger, jumped out of the carriage, and was in a minute at the side of the old woman, took her arm, and led her away from the chasm. The poor woman was blind, and had been left alone for a moment, the boy who attended her having gone to fetch some water to quench his thirst. There is no\' doubt the poor creature would have lost her life ; and when her little grandson returned the Empress reproached him in strong terms for his thoughtlessness, gave the woman a few gold pieces, and continued her I \\ 2 94 Elizabeth^ Empress o{ Austria drive, having been detained for a quarter of an hour by the occurrence. In 1887 the Empress spent some time at Cromer in Norfolk. One day shortly after noon she was walking along the coast, when she suddenly observed a large crowd of people congregated around some object, and on enquiry was informed that a railway porter of the , Great Eastern Railway Company, named Walter Moules, had been accidentally drowned. The Empress enquired after the home of the poor man, and directed her steps there without delay, finding the wife and children at dinner. They had no idea of the mis- fortune which had befallen them, and in order to prevent any one telling the terrible news too abruptly to the widow Her Majesty called her to her side, and in the most considerate manner imparted to her the sad intelligence. She was just in time, for at that moment the dead body was brought to the house. With a promise to be a friend, the Empress closed her conversation with these words, "" Pray for your husband and take the best care of your little ones,"" and then left quickly. A few hours afterwards a lady-in-waiting appeared at the humble cottage of the grief-stricken widow, handing her in the name of the Empress a purse containing ^400. Around Gasturi in Corfu the tales of her benevo- lence are innumerable ; but she especially endeared Reminiscences and Anecdotes 295 herself by her kindness to an anchorite, who had selected a small rocky islet in the bay as his abode. Well aware that it was his desire not to be dis- turbed by people in his meditations, the Empress used frequently to row all by herself in a small boat out to the island, in order to leave baskets with eatables for the hermit, and when absent her steward at the Achilleon was instructed to see that the man did not buffer for want of food. A poor octogenarian, who had been for many years stricken with rheumatism, and had been at last reluctantly compelled to leave the hut in which she had spent all her life to enter the almshouses, was once spoken to by the Empress when visiting the institution. The poor woman expressed her grief that she was obliged to leave her old home, where she had hoped to spend her last days. Deeply touched. Her Majesty promised to see that she should return to her old abode, and accordingly the next day the old woman was removed to her former habitation, which had been made comfortable under the Empress\'s personal supervision, and here she lived for many years under the special protection and on the bounty of the mistress of the Achilleon. A gravestone, erected by her protectress, now marks the place where the poor creature is buried. So many similar and well-authenticated instances 296 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria of the murdered lady\'s beneficence could we give that a volume might be filled with them, but those related will suflice to show the beautiful character of the woman who, herself such a great sufferer, never tired of alleviating the lot of others. A very pretty story is told of the late Empress\'s father, which, as it is in close connection with her birth, may find a place here. At Christmastide 1837 Duke Maximilian took a stroll through the grounds near his castle, when he met a poor old woman carrying a heavy bundle of firewood. He asked her why she carried such a large quantity, and she replied, "" Well, sir, this is Christmas Eve, and as we have no benevolent Christ-child visiting us I intend that my children shall at least have a warm room. The Duke was deeply touched by the simple explanation, and said, "" My dear woman, the benevolent Christ-child has already visited me, and brought me a gift which has given me so great joy, that you also shall have a joyful Christmas Eve and shall participate in my happiness."" Soon after- wards there appeared at the cottage of the astonished family two ducal servants, carrying two large baskets filled with eatables, fruit, and dainties, and an envelope which contained a banknote for two hundred florins (about ^20). The Christmas gift to which the Duke referred was Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Empress Reminiscences and Anecdotes of Austria, who was born on the morning ot that day. One of the officers of the Court has related the following interesting episode. He says that for some months preceding the death of the Empress disagree- able presentiments had been experienced in certain circles, owing to an incident which occurred at 298 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Schonbrunn on the 24th of April of the present year (1898.) The soldier who was posted on sentry duty in a corridor, which is separated only by a glass door from the passage leading to the chapel, came with pallid face and trembling steps to the commandant of the guard, and told him that he had seen the form of a female clad in white and carrying a lighted taper approaching him in the corridor. He at once challenged her, whereupon the figure turned round and returned along the passage ; the man followed the apparition, and then observed a light in the chapel. The sentry was so positive concerning the facts which he alleged, that a strict search was forthwith instituted, but without any result. This incident immediately recalled one of those weird legends that are so common in royal and aristo- cratic families — namely, that the appearance of a female attired in white presages death or ruin. This particular ""White Lady"" was seen in 1867, some time before the execution of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico ; again in 1869, immediately before the death of the Crown Prince Rudolf; and, later still, before the drowning of the ill-fated Archduke John Salvator, better known to us as Johann Orth. In Court circles it is positively declared that this dreaded white spectre actually made its appearance at Schonbrunn on the 24th of April. Reminiscences and Anecdotes 299 A statement made by Mr. Barker, the Empress\'s English reader, who has been already mentioned, tends to increase these feelings of superstition rather than to diminish them. He says that during the last excursion made by Her Majesty at Caux a raven suddenly descended upon the rocky plateau upon which the party were resting, and in passing the Empress its wings brushed her hair. This was looked upon as an evil omen. Another strange incident is said to have occurred just prior to the Empress\'s departure for Geneva, which was related by members of her suite. She passed a few days at the Grand Hotel at Caux. On one Friday morning, as she was sitting in the balcony of the hotel, a lady suddenly appeared before the building. She was clad in a white costume with a green bodice. She took a seat under one of the many umbrella tents, and gazed fixedly in a strange manner at Her Majesty. The Empress, evidently disquieted, gave orders that the stranger should be spoken to. Two attendants started to fulfil the order, but the lady disappeared, and in spite of the most careful search, lasting for two hours, she could not be found. In the afternoon the Empress suddenly ordered her departure. The bed upon which the Empress expired has been sent by the Emperor\'s command to Vienna ; it is made of rosewood, but otherwise it is extremely simple. 300 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria The instruments used in the post-mortem examina- tion, as well as those utilised in embalming the body, were burnt in the morgue at Geneva, to prevent any later possible misuse of them. Dr. Christomanos, formerly reader to the late Empress, has published some extremely interesting reminiscences of Her Majesty. He states among other things that the Empress knew that she was considered an eccentric woman. She remarked to him once, ** People ascribe all my eccentricities to my being a Wittelsbach."" She often smiled at the poverty of life which crowned heads endure. "" How I pity the poor Emperor!"" she said on one occasion, ""for he has no time to do anything else but attend to the duties of his position."" Speaking of Bismarck, Her Majesty once said : \'\' I think Bismarck was also a disciple of Schopenhauer. He could not bear women — perhaps with the single exception of his wife. He disliked queens. The first time I saw him he was exceedingly stifF. He would have liked to have said "" — here she smiled — "" * The ladies had better remain in their apartments.\' I think all his hatred of England is on account of the Queen. The poor Empress Frederick has also had to suffer."" CHAPTER XIII. THE ASSASSINATION. 301 CHAPTER XIII.; THE ASSASSINATION. "" It is a very cruel world."" H, RipER Haggard. IN the eighth chapter of this work I have traced the movements of the late Empress from the time that she left Vienna early in the year to her last arrival in Geneva, and it is my sad duty to relate here the terrible crime which ended the life of the sufFerer. Had she not deliberately dispensed with protection, it is improbable that the assassin could ever have approached her. Peace be to Elizabeth of Austria\'s ashes ! May she rest indeed ! She has, in joining the countless host of the dead, been reunited to her son and brother-in-law, both of whom she loved so well ; and to her at least death was without doubt a happy release, for life had had nothing to ofFer since the terrible tragedy of Mayerling. The one who suffers most is the lonely venerable sovereign at the Hofburg in Vienna, and one can only fervently hope that he may be spared any further blow, although it is difficult to conceive 303 ■ I 304 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria of any deep grief that has not already been visited upon him. From the Quai du Mont Blanc there leads a broad avenue through some gardens and park-like squares up to the town of Geneva. This is named the Place des Alpes. On the left, looking from the lake, is the Rue des Alpes, with the Hotel de la Paix ; on the right, the Fabris Street, with the Hotel Beau Rivage, which forms the corner, and stands between the Hotel Richemond and the Hotel D\'Angleterre, In the middle of the square, near the footway, there stands enclosed within an iron fence the large monument of Duke Charles of Brunswick, who, as will be remembered, left his enormous fortune to the town of Geneva. In front of the high tower-like structure there lie two lions, looking dreamily out upon the blue waters of Lake Leman. The Quai itself is adorned with white statues, patches of lawn, and many-coloured carpets of flowers, with trees planted in profusion. Near by is the landing-place of the steamers which ply upon the lake, and a litde farther south there is a second landing-stage. It was on the way from the Hotel Beau Rivage to this stage that, on Saturday, the loth of September, at about 12.40 a.m., the Empress was assassinated by the anarchist Lucheni. The Empress had arrived on Friday by steamer from Montreux, in order to pay THEN -^■/; YORK PUBi.i : i:.^KARY A8TOR , LLNOX AND TiLOEN FOUNOATiONt. The Assassination 307 a visit to the Baroness Rothschild at Pregny, a place celebrated for its magnificent gardens and park. As usual on her journeys, she travelled incognito, and engaged rooms at the Hotel Beau Rivage under the name of the Countess of Hohenembs. The police had no official notice, and therefore no official knowledge, of the presence of Her Majesty. However, the chief of the police department at Geneva, M. Virieux, states that he had, without the knowledge of the Empress, of whose aversion to such regulations he was well aware, placed some detectives round about the hotel at Caux during the last week of her stay there ; but in spite of the greatest precautions she noticed that she was guarded, and asked at once that the detec- tives might be withdrawn, a desire which M. Virieux acceded to. What really took place is told in the following way by one who witnessed the tragedy : — "" The Empress was walking, attended by a lady-in- waiting and followed at some distance by a footman, from the Beau Rivage to the landing-stage. When she was near the stage of the Quai du Mont Blanc, there came from the opposite direction a young man, accom- panied by another, who was distinguished by a heavy grey beard. When quite near Her Majesty, the former suddenly threw himself upon her and stabbed her through the heart. The Empress Elizabeth fell to the 3o8 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria ground, but with the assistance of her lady and\' some passengers who were near she was able to rise again, and walked to the landing-bridge and reached the steamer. But she had hardly arrived there when she seemed to become suddenly ill, and with a weak voice THE hStEL beau RIVAOE. she said, \' What has happened ? \' and then became unconscious. M. Teisset, a member of the Chamber of Commerce of Geneva, carried Her Majesty in his arms to her cabin after she had fainted on deck. The captain was reluctant to order his vessel to proceed, but upon the request of the suite of Her Majesty he gave the signal to leave the jetty. The Assassination 3^9 However, very shortly afterwards it was noticed, to the terror of all, that the Empress seemed unable to recover her consciousness. The ladies about her, who had done everything possible to assist the Empress, observed a small spot of blood upon her bodice. Her condition seeming to be serious, the steamer turned back, and a stretcher was improvised of oars and sail- cloth, and upon this she was reverently and carefully carried back to the hotel by officers and sailors of the boat."" The wife of the proprietor of the hotel, Frau Mayer, reports the following concerning the last moments of Her Majesty : — *\' It was two o\'clock when the Empress was brought to the hotel, and carried into her bedroom. I was called to give such assistance as was in my power. We took off her clothes, which had already been partly loosened, when we noticed two small drops of blood, and one a little larger of very light red colour: on the body itself there was only a small wound, but no blood was visible. Countess Sztaray exclaimed in consternation, \' The Empress has been stabbed ! \' The Empress was lying with a pale face and closed eyes upon her bed. Soon after she arrived in her room she sighed twice deeply : these were the last signs of life. She lay on the stretcher as if asleep, and with no outward show of pain. When we removed her from •r 310 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria the litter to the bed she was evidently dead : she must have died when still on the stretcher. Two phy- sicians, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer, arrived at this moment, and also a priest ; but all remedies proved vam. The autopsy of Dr. Golay showed some interest- ing details of the nature of the wound inflicted by Lucheni\'s weapon. He states that the fatal instrument was driven with such violence (fully 3^ inches in the body) that it broke the fourth rib, pierced the lungs and pericardium, and penetrated the heart from top to bottom, finally coming out from the lower part of the left ventricle. As the weapon was excessively sharp, the bleeding was very slight, and only small drops of blood flowed into the pericardium. So long as this latter organ was not too full, the action of the heart was not impeded : this explains why the unfortunate Empress, even with a wound right through her heart, was able to walk for some distance. But as the pericardium gradually filled with blood death ensued. Had the dagger not been drawn out, Her Majesty would probably have lived som* time longer, because as the weapon filled the wound it would have stopped the loss of blood. It appears that Dr. Golay had actually photographed the wound, but was obliged to deposit the negative with the Procurator- General, by whom it was subsequently destroyed. In • • ! L > AST OH ■^ \' L\\ ^^\'\'\'^ \\ tS- KU<o..T,cre ^ cr-\'^^\' i The Assassination 313 the opinion of the physicians the death of the Empress was gradual and quite painless. The weapon which the criminal used was found afterwards in the passage of a house in the Rue des Alpes. It was picked up by the concierge, who thought it belonged to a labourer who had moved from the house the day before, and who, he imagined, had lost it there ; and for this reason he did not notify the police of its discovery until the next day. It was a triangular file, which was roughly fastened into a wooden handle, the whole length of the instru- ment being six and a half inches, a little under four inches being the length of the file. There was no trace of blood upon it, and the point was broken off: the break most likely happened when the murderer threw the weapon into the passage. As soon as the dastardly deed was perpetrated the assassin started to run along the Rue des Alpes, and evidently tried to reach the wide Place des Alpes, where he hoped to be able to hide himself ; he was followed by two cabdrivers, Victor Vuillemin and Louis Chamartin, who from their standing-place upon the Quai had witnessed the deed, and who were joined by a sailor, Albert Fiana. Before Lucheni could reach the Place he was overtaken and handed over to the policeman Kaiser, who brought him to the nearest station. The murder was done in the most cunning way. 3^4 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria The assassin had no doubt selected a file, and had converted the same into a dagger of dull metal, well calculating that a bright steel weapon would have soon betrayed his intention ; it was in this way that the Countess Sztaray, in spite of her being quite near the Empress, could not see that she had been stabbed, and entirely refused to believe that Her Majesty was wounded till she saw with her own eyes the wound on her body ; she and others who were near had up to then been under the impression that the anarchist had simply struck her, and that her fall was due to the powerful stroke. However we may search the pages of history, we can hardly find a case where such a deed has been committed in the populous centre of a town, during hours when the sun was lighting up the roads with its full summer rays. How pathetic seems the occur- rence, when we think of the slim figure, dressed in the deepest mourning, walking slowly along the Quai to reach the steamer, which should have taken her to the place she had selected for quietness and seclusion — who bore no ill-will to any one, and was only desirous of being allowed to enjoy quietly such pleasures as the contemplation of nature could afford her ! So full of confidence was she that she refused to allow any precautions to be taken for her safety. Yet even so gentle a creature could 1 The Assassination 317 not escape the murderous instrument of the fanatic. How terrible a deed and how far-reaching in its consequences the assassin can scarcely have foreseen. A whole continent mourns the loss of this noble woman, whose life was a linked chain of golden deeds of benevolence and sympathy, whose sole desire was for purity and beauty, who has dried so many eyes wet with tears, and who ever opened her heart to the appeals of all who like herself had borne grief and suffering. She had arrived ill, but full of hopes ; and wherever she went she won the affection and love of all who came in contact with her. But in spite of all she was not permitted to find a peaceful end ; nor was she, whose whole life had been a prayer, vouchsafed the last consolations of her religion. From the statement of the Countess Sztaray we gather the following : "" When Her Majesty had regained her consciousness on board the steamer, I asked her, * Does Your Majesty feel any pain ? \' and she replied faintly, \' No.\' She opened her eyes and gazed with gratitude and melancholy sorrow on those near her who were endeavouring to restore her by opening her corsets and loosening her bodice. The only words I heard afterwards were, * What has happened ? \' By this time the steamer had turned round, as Captain Roux feared that the condition of 3^8 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria the Empress was serious. Second Officer Gobel im- provised a litter, and it was the captain himself, with some sailors, who carried the unconscious lady to the Hotel Beau Rivage, up to the first storey, where the apartments were situated, which she had left only an hour before. Fortunately there was a nurse staying at the hotel, and she, with my assistance and the help of the proprietress of the hotel, took off Her Majesty\'s shoes and cut up her dress. By this time Dr. Golay had arrived, and he immediately tried artificial respira- tion, whilst the nurse endeavoured to restore sensibility by rubbing the body of the Empress, which had commenced to grow cold, with eau-de-Cologne and vinegar. All seemed in vain ; the doctor made a small incision into the artery of her right wrist, but no blood appeared, which made it certain that she was dead. A priest who had been on the steamer arrived, in order to offer Her Majesty the last consola- tions of religion, according to the Roman Catholic rites ; but he was too late. I believe that the Empress died at the moment that we laid her upon the bed. After her death was confirmed we all knelt down, and with tears prayed to the Almighty for the repose of that noble soul, which must have reached His throne by this time."" As to the assassination itself the same witness says that Lucheni rushed up to the Empress, and seemed The Assassination 319 to stumble before her ; she observed him stretch out his hand, as if to save himself from falling; then she caught the Empress in her arms as she was staggering. The Countess is convinced that the Empress died without knowing that she was the victim of an assassin\'s weajmn. In another inter- v i e w with Her Majesty\'s lady-in- waiting she emphati- cally stated that she had not seen any weapon in the hand of Lucheni, and that she was under the impression that Her Majesty had only had a fainting fit, due to the heavy blow which the as- sassin had given her. coumtss s -no She had not enter- tained any fear of serious consequences ; in fact, almost up to the last moment she had no idea that the Empress was wounded, and she was unable to see any mark on the bodice. It was only when Captain Roux had ex- pressed his opinion that the condition of the Empress was serious, and had come down into her cabin and cut r 320 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria the corsets of the fainting lady, that it was noticed that she was wounded. He immediately made enquiries as to whether there was a physician on board ; but it was found that there was none, and upon that he gave orders to turn back. It was a strange coincidence that serious apprehensions were felt in Vienna in connection with the Emperor\'s sudden determination to make a tour through Bosnia and Herzegovina during the course of September, for the purpose of ascertaining for himself whether there were any grounds for the continuous complaints made by the Mohammedan inhabitants against the Austrian administrators in those provinces. He had been so proverbially unlucky throughout his reign that people in Vienna were labouring under an impression that some untoward event would occur at the last moment to put a stop to the Jubilee festivities organised for next December (1898), and the opinion was freely expressed that it would be quite in keeping with his past career if he were shot down by some murderer on the very eve of the fiftieth anniversary of his accession to the throne. His life is safe enough elsewhere in the Dual Empire — as, no matter what the political sentiments of the people, they are all united in one common feeling of love and loyal affection for their Emperor. But this loyalty does not extend to Herzegovina or to Bosnia, provinces The Assassination 321 which in reality belong to the Ottoman Empire, and which are occupied by Austria much in the same manner as Egypt is held by the English, with the difference that Mohammedan fanaticism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is infinitely more intense and bitter than in Egypt. It must be remembered, too, that a Mohammedan who slays the Christian despoiler of the Caliph is firmly convinced that, far from committing a crime, he is accomplishing a good deed, ensuring his eternal salva- tion, as well as the gratitude and veneration of all the members of his faith. An \'* untoward event "" so much feared by the people of Austria has certainly occurred ; the life of the Emperor has not been aimed at, but that of his beloved consort has been taken. It was in the evening of the loth of September last that the first news of the terrible tragedy in Geneva arrived in Vienna. The detailed official account was not published until Sunday night, the nth. It was pointed out that the assassin, Lucheni, whose name is unknown to any of the police in Europe, most likely bore an alias. It was found that his original intention was to assassinate the Duke of Orleans ; but as this proved impossible he resolved to attack the Empress, whom he had followed in her excursions for several days, intending to seize a favourable moment. The cynicism with which he replied to the question of the 21 322 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria judicial authorities bordered almost on insanity. He declared on examination that he had seen the Empress four years ago at Buda-Pesth, and immediately recog- nised her again. He added, "" I hope she is dead ; that blow did not fail."" It is quite impossible to describe the feelings of despair, rage, and horror which sw ^pt over the Viennese when the intelligence of the murder of their beloved Empress became known. They far exceeded in intensity those caused by the news of the death of the Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889. At first no one would believe that such a crime could have been perpetrated, especially considering the character of the victim. When there- fore doubt became certainty, the utmost excitement seized upon the masses, who gathered in the streets and public places in thousands, and hurried instinctively to the imperial palace, hoping to hear fresh details. Many people wept aloud, especially the women, who were seen in the streets wringing their hands, and muttering curses against the assassin. In a surprisingly short time the news spread to the outlying districts. The murder of the Empress roused a tempest of fury, such as has scarcely ever before been seen in Vienna. A servant of the imperial house in livery rushed from the palace into the crowd, crying, ** Where is the murderer of the Empress ? "" and fell senseless to the ground. The first official intelligence came to the Foreign The \'.Assassination 3^3 Minister, Count Golukowsky, in the shape of a cypher telegram from the Austrian Consul at Geneva ; then followed two messages almost simultaneously, addressed to the principal equerry of the Emperor, from the lady-in-waiting, the Countess Sztaray. The Foreign Secretary drove at once to Schonbrunn, where he found the Emperor making preparations for the autumn manoeuvres in Hungary. The effect upon the vener- able monarch when hearing the fearful news was over- whelming ; he remained in a kind of stupor for some time. Later on the Emperor said to Prince Liechten- stein, who for years had accompanied the Empress on her journeys as equerry and was much beloved by the imperial pair, ** That a man could be found to attack such a woman, whose whole life was spent in doing good and who never injured any person, is to me i ncomprehensible . \' \' Towards the evening the Emperor drove, amidst sympathising crowds, to the Hofburg. The streets through which he had to pass were crowded, and many angry mutterings were heard when it became known that the assassin was an Italian, and threats were audible among the working classes. Many attempts were made to quiet the growing excitement, and the crowds were told not to throw the crime of an individual on an entire nation. The Swiss Charge d\'AfFaires has stated that the 3^4 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria Empress was guarded for some time by the Swiss police, but that she had such an objection to this that it had to be stopped. It was an unfortunate circum- stance that the Empress was not accompanied in her excursion by any gentleman of her suite, as then the crime might possibly have been prevented. On Sunday morning the Emperor Francis Joseph telegraphed that he consented to a post-mortem examination. This took place at two o\'clock in the afternoon, and we have already given the interesting but melancholy results of Dr. Golay\'s autopsy. The body of the Empress Elizabeth, robed in white, was laid the next morning in the triple coffin in which it was conveyed to Vienna. The coffin, which was lined with a profusion of white satin, was placed in a car, converted for the time being into a chapelle ardente. Near the bier was a prie-dieUy on which lay a rosary and a cross ; the floor was covered with a black carpet with flecks of silver, and the walls were draped with black cloth relieved by silver stars. Nuns, sent by the Bishop of Fribourg, knelt beside the coffin. The adjoining rooms were filled with wreaths of flowers, of which a great number had come from Geneva itself Most of them were tied with red and yellow or yellow and black ribbons. Among those who sent floral tributes were the foreign officers attending the military manoeuvres in the neighbourhood. The Assassination 325 Reluctantly I am obliged, in order to give a com- plete history of the dastardly crime, to speak more fully of the murderer himself. He is a young man born of Italian parentage in Paris, but he had never known either his father or mother. At the age of ten he had left the charity school at Parma, in which he had been brought up, and, thrown upon the streets without resources, he had 3^6 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria obtained work as an unskilled labourer In order to make a livelihood. At the age of twenty he performed his military service, principally at Naples ; on leaving the regiment he obtained a situation as valet to the Prince of Arragon, but only remained in that service for three months. Anarchist ideas began to gain possession of his mind, and prevented his remaining in a state of servitude any longer. In 1894 the hazard of a life of adventure brought him to Buda-Pesth, where he saw the late Empress for the first time. After long wanderings in search of work he at last arrived at Lausanne, where for the first time he obtained work ; it was here that he bought, outside an old curiosity shop, the file with which he perpetrated his crime. He declared that he had not any preconceived idea of the use to which it should be put. In prison Lucheni boasted of his terrible deed ; he expressed no repentance, and said it was committed, not to avenge his misery or that of others, which would have been idiotic, but in order that such crimes following one upon another might cause all those arrogant people who fill such positions to fear and tremble. He concluded his statement with the words, \'* I am an anarchist by conviction."" During his examination by M. Auberti at Geneva he stated : "" I came to Geneva to kill a sovereign, with the object of giving an example to those who The Assassination 327 suffer and who do nothing to improve their social position ; it did not matter to me who the sovereign was whom I should kill. I had heard that the Duke of Orleans was at Geneva, and my first idea was to kill him ; but the Duke had left before I arrived. It was not a woman I struck, but an Empress ; it was a crown that I had in view. I acted on my own initiative, without any pressure, and I alone am responsible for the deed."" I need scarcely say that the emotion aroused in Switzerland was almost as intense as that in Austria, and in order to. show the horror which the crime had caused amongst the people the Swiss Federal Council organised a great public demonstration of regret and sympathy on the morning of the 12th of September, which proved to be the most imposing affair ever seen in that country. The famous big bell of the cathedral, known as La Clemence, began to peal at half-past eleven, just as the procession, which had been mustering for some time previously, began to move past the Hotel Beau Rivage. At the head marched a squad of gendarmes with reversed arms, and a few paces after four huissiers in cocked hats and cloaks, half red, half yellow, their leader bearing a mace covered with crape. The members of the Geneva Government came next, headed by President Gavard, and following them a long train 3^8 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria of civilians in black, members of the Legislature, municipal authorities, delegates from the forty-seven communes of the canton, deputations from the uni- versities, foreign consuls and consular officials, etc. The general public joined the procession, which took more than an hour to pass the hotel. The sun was intensely hot, but every head was uncovered. Order was kept by firemen, who wore armlets of black and yellow — the Austrian colours. All eyes were turned on the terrace of the hotel, where a number of personages in deep mourning were gathered. Among them were General Berzeviczy, Grand Marshal of the Court ; Countess Zichy, lady of honour to the late Empress ; Count Kuefstein, the Austrian Minister ; and other members of the imperial suite, and a priest in plain clothes. Though the crowd was immense there was no accident and no disorder. The slightest direction of the police commissary on duty was instantly obey^, and there was a general desire that the demonstration shoujd be characterised by no manifestation of feeling beyond that of respect for the dead and sympathy with the bereaved household and family. Most of the shops and places of business were closed. The Emperor of Austria sent the following telegram to the Federal Council, in reply to that of the President The Assassination 329 of the Federation, in which he had expressed his strong and deep-felt sympathy in the name of the Swiss people : — \'* Deeply touched by the sympathy expressed in so warm a manner, I thank the Federal Council and the whole Swiss people from the bottom of my heart for their participation in the bitter sorrow which the inscrutable decree of Providence has brought upon me.*\' The Austrian Ambassador, Count Kuefstein, tele- graphed to the Federal Council at Geneva as follows : — "" Count Golukowski has charged me to thank the Federal Council for the cordial sympathy which it has expressed both through me and through the medium of the Swiss Legation in Vienna on the occasion of the death under such tragic circumstances of Her Majesty the Queen and Empress. I am at the same time instructed to convey the most heartfelt thanks, and to inform you that His Excellency will not fail to bring these demonstrations of sympathy to the knowledge of his august master."" The blessing of the remains in Geneva was carried out, in accordance with a request addressed to the Swiss Government, without military honours. The Federal Council received, both from all parts of Switzerland and from abroad, innumerable messages expressing sorrow and indignation at the crime. This council attended in a body the ceremony, which took 33^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria place in Geneva at two o\'clock in the afternoon of the 13th of September. Early on the 14th of the same month the special train conveying the body of the murdered Empress started on its long and mournful journey from the place where she had lost her life to the place where her mortal remains were to be laid to their eternal rest. Before the coffin was finally sealed up the last legal forms were complied with, the identity of the corpse being proved by the presence of the Austro-Swiss authorities. The coffin was fitted with two glass windows, covered with doors, which could be slid back, so as to permit a sight of the contents ; these doors were locked— one key was given into the custody of the Master of the Household of the late Empress, whilst the other was handed to the Master of the Ceremonies. For the purpose of identification the face of the Empress was exposed to view ; everybody who saw it was deeply touched by the tranquillity and peaceful expression worn by the countenance of the august dead. The formal certificate of death declares that the passing away was easy and painless. In the register of deaths in the town of Geneva the name of the Empress is thus entered : "" Empress Elizabeth of Austria, Queen of Hungary "" (then follows a complete list of her titles and dignities), "" sixty-one The Assassination 333 years of age, died on the loth of September, 1898, at 2,10 p.m., at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Geneva."" The entry of the Empress\'s death stands in the register between those of a child and a woman, who expired on the same day. The identification or "" recognition "" having been duly finished, the coffin containing the remains was removed at half-past eight in the morning ; the hearse was drawn by four horses, almost hidden by their long black trappings, and was followed by two other cars, each completely covered with wreaths and flowers. The whole way to the station the streets were lined on both sides by firemen, behind whom were enormous crowds - of people, massed many rows deep. The approaches to the hotel had been cleared at an early hour, and all the neighbouring streets were either barred by cords drawn across and firmly fastened or by light barricades. The conduct of the people was, however, everywhere exemplary, rendering the task of maintaining order an easy one. The coffin, which was almost invisible at the obse- quies, owing to the mass of flowers surrounding it, was of polished oak, adorned with raised mouldings and silver fittings and handles. The four feet by which it was supported were also of silver, and the funeral car itself was decorated with ornaments of the same metal. The canopy was surmounted by a 334 Elizabeth, Empress of \'Austria silver cross, and at each corner were white plumes fringed with silver. The four horses also bore white plumes on their heads. The coffin was brought down from the chapelle ardente and placed on the car by eight bearers, imme- diately after which the cortege was formed, a force of gendarmes and firemen acting as escort. Among the wreaths upon the hearse itself were tributes from Queen Amalie of Portugal, the Queen of Roumania, the inhabitants of Geneva, and others from various Swiss cantons. Those on the two cars following included wreaths from the Swiss Federal Council, the Council of State, the consular body in Geneva, the Italian colony, various political associations, the Spanish colony, the ladies of Geneva, the Comte de Montholon, the French Ambassador to Switzerland, and the foreign military attaches present at that time in Geneva for the annual manoeuvres. Immediately behind the two floral cars came a large number of closed carriages, two abreast, those on the right containing the representatives of the Emperor and the personages of the Austrian Court sent from Vienna, and those on the left the members of the Swiss Federal Council, headed by the President and Vice-President of the Confederation, the horses being all decked with black trappings. By the side of each coachman was seated a Federal The Assassination 335 usher, dressed in a scarlet pilgrim\'s robe. All the official mourners wore black with white ties. The occupants of the five Austrian Court carriages were as follows : — First Carriage : Count Bellegarde, Grand Master of the late Empress\'s Court ; and Countess Harrach, Her Majesty\'s Mistress of the Robes. Second Carriage : General Berzeviczy, the Grand Marshal of the Austrian Court ; and the Countess Festetics, lady-in-waiting to the late Empress. Third Carriage : Count von Abensperg-Traun, Grand Chamberlain of the Austrian Court ; and Countess Sztaray, the lady-in-waiting who was with the Empress when she was assassinated. Fourth Carriage: Mr. Barker, the .late Empress\'s Greek reader ; and M. Paoli, the French police functionary who was always appointed to accompany Her Majesty when travelling in France. Fifth Carriage : Count von Kuefstein, Austrian Minister to Switzerland ; and his Secretary of Legation, Baron Giskra. Other carriages followed with members of the Empress\'s suite and a number of her personal attendants. Another detachment of gendarmes and firemen brought up the rear. During the passage of the procession from the hotel 33^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria to the station, which was reached in a little less than a quarter of an hour, the great bell of the cathedral, known as La Clemence, tolled continually. Not only were the roads along the route taken by the pro- cession thronged with people, but every window of every house commanding a view of the cortege was filled with people anxious to pay their last homage to a good and noble woman. Nevertheless, the pro- cession passed by in the most absolute silence, every man\'s head being uncovered, and numbers of women crossing themselves devoutly as the coffin passed. The main hall of the Carnavin Station, through which the coffin had to pass on being transferred from the hearse to the special ti;ain, had, by the directions of the Jura-Si mplon Railway Company, been converted into a large mortuary chamber, the walls being draped with black, while the floor was tastefully arranged with a large number of palms and other foliage plants. The entrance to the hall was also hung with black draperies, from amid which, over the doorway, the Austrian imperial eagle stood out boldly on a white ground. As the remains were removed from the car a benediction was once more pronounced over them by the chief ecclesiastic of the cathedral. The coffin was then borne to the special train which was to convey it to Vienna, and was placed in the carriage which had been arranged for its reception. The only wreaths The Assassination 337 placed in the car with it were those sent by the Queens of Portugal and Roumania, and those of General Berzeviczy and Countess Sztaray. As soon as these had been arranged the doors of the car were closed and 33^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria hermetically sealed, after which the Swiss civil authorities passed in turn before the group of Austrian dignitaries who were to travel by the train to Vienna, and gave them a farewell salute. The Emperor\'s representatives then took their places in the saloon-car. An adjoining carriage was occupied by several high railway officials. In the meantime the remaining wreaths and flowers from the hearse, and those from the two cars which followed it, had been conveyed to the carriage reserved for them. This was next to the engine, and follow- ing it was the special car with the Empress\'s remains ; next came a carriage occupied by servants, two saloon- cars- for the members of the Court and their suites, a dining-car, and a brake. All the Swiss Federal authorities remained on the platform until the train started, the Austrian repre- sentatives at the same time standing on. the platform of their saloon-car, and again exchanging salutes with them as the train left. The day before the crime the Empress had visited Baroness Julia Rothschild, wife of Adolphe Rothschild of Paris, at Pregny. Some days previously an intimation had been sent from Caux of the intended arrival of the Empress on Friday, the 9th, to take lunch at Pregny. Baroness Rothschild proposed that she should send her yacht, which would come via Caux and Territet direct to Bellevue, without obliging The Assassination 339 Her Majesty to touch at Geneva. The Empress declined this kind offer, but on the day fixed she appeared with Countess Sztaray at the Baroness\'s villa. She had left her carriage some distance from the gates, and had walked the rest of the way ; she was in excellent spirits, and spoke to the steward of the estate, with whom she had become acquainted on a former visit. After lunch, at which a band played, a walk was taken in the splendid park ; Her Majesty led the way with the Baroness, conversing with her in French. The Empress especially admired the orchids, which were then growing in great quantities in the hot-houses, and the Baroness offered to send her a bouquet, which Her Majesty accepted. The Empress then returned to Geneva. It is a pathetic fact that these orchids formed part of the magnificent wreath laid by the Baroness on the coffin of the Empress. In closing this chapter I may refer to the enormous number of telegrams of condolence received by the Emperor. Even from the remotest parts of the world, such as Africa and Australia, came sympathetic messages. The Queen of England was one of the first to telegraph: — ""Words fail me in which to express my heartfelt sympathy and my horror. It is too dreadful, too cruel. May God support and protect you I "" Victoria, ♦\' Balmoral, September lO/A,"" 340 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria The German Emperor expressed his feelings in the following words: — \'\' Deeply shaken and still unnerved, I can scarcely find words to say how I feel for you, and how I suffer with you in sorrowing over your heavy loss. It is a trial from Heaven that we mortals cannot understand, which only weighs us down with fearful severity. The only consolation for us poor human creatures is that it is ordained."" « King Humbert telegraphed : — "" The cruel misfortune which has struck you fills us with shuddering and indignation. I wish I were near you to show you by my affection the share I feel in your pain. Margherita and I join with all our hearts in your prayers and fears, praying God to afford you that consolation which He alone can give."" The Czar and his consort sent the following message : — *\' We are horrified to receive such dreadful and unhappy tidings. In this cruel trial we would express to you our sincere feelings of sorrow and pain. May God sustain you and lend you strength to bear this irreparable loss ! ""Alexandra and Nicholas."" A message was also sent by the Lord Mayor of London to this effect : — . "" The Lord Mayor desires in the name of the citizens to express the deep indignation and sorrow felt in the City The Assassination 341 of London by all classes alike at the terrible crime that has deprived Austro-Hungary of her Empress-Queen and its august ruler of his beloved consort."" To these wires may be added one from the President of the United States : — \'\' I have heard with profound regret of the assassination of Her Majesty the Empress while at Geneva, and tender Your Majesty the deep sympathy of the Government and people of the United States. \'\'William McKinley."" Among the many wreaths and other floral tributes with which the coffin and its surroundings were crowded was one which was enveloped with the American colours and had the following inscription on its ribbons : "" From the President of the United States : a tribute of heartfelt sympathy, in memory of a noble and gracious lady."" There was also a silver palm branch, which was placed on it in the name of M. Felix Faure, and a coronal in that of the Govern- ment and the Republic. CHAPTER XIV. AT REST— OBSEQUIES IN VIENNA AND UNIVERSAL MOURNING. 343 CHAPTER XIV. AT REST— OBSEQUIES IN VIENNA AND UNIVERSAL MOURNING. "" Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in their dust"" Shirley. THE 17th of September, 1898, will ever be remembered by the thousands and thousands who thronged the Austrian capital to pay their last tribute to their murdered Empress. It was a beautiful autumn day, the sun appeared in all his splendour, not a cloud was visible in the deep blue sky, when the Empress Elizabeth was placed in the tomb of her ancestors. Nature, whom she had loved so dearly, seemed to have put on her most lovely garb. It was about ten o\'clock at night on the 15th when the body of the Empress reached Vienna by the railroad which is called, after herself, the y ** Elizabeth-bahn."" \\ Never since Austria won for herself a name among the nations of the earth, has the home- 345 \'-7 7 \' t\' ^ / . .. A 34^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria coming of any of her sovereigns proved so mournful or impressive as this — the last journey of the accom- plished and beloved Empress Elizabeth. From city to city the funeral train rolled slowly onwards, accom- panied by the tears and orisons of the deeply afflicted people, who once warmly welcomed her as a blushing young bride, and to-day bemoan the loss of the beneficent lady who lessened their sorrows and intensified their joys during the most eventful period of the century. In Innsbruck, in Hall, in Salzburg, in a word all along the route taken by the cortege^ the entire population, their houses draped in mourning, their persons clothed in deepest black, and their hearts full of love and sympathy for the gallant and dis- consolate old Emperor, turned out to pay the last honours to their idolised Empress. A representative of the united Swiss railways had escorted the imperial train to the frontier, and at three o\'clock on the morning of the 15th had reached the loyal province of Tyrol, where, despite the early hour, crowds assembled at the station, and literally covered the space around the hearse with fresh-cut dewy flowers. In spite of the orders which had been given to keep the platforms clear of people, it was impossible to prevent the sorrowing subjects from doing reverence to the beloved dead. Crowns and garlands of flowers were laid round the coflin Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 347 by various corporations and public bodies, and that ofFered by the entire population of the province was woven of palms, lilies, and white roses, and bore simply the legend, "" Tyrol to its dearly beloved Empress."" The Court ceremony, which took place at night, although suggestive in its detaik of the days of Philip II. of Spain, and even of the more ancient times of Byzantium, had for its aim and object the delivery of the Empress\'s body by her own Master of the Household to the chief Court officers of the Emperor. Vienna had become completely transformed. The flagstaffs on either side of the spacious Ringstrasse, from the tops of which the national colours had been gaily floating ever since the official inauguration of the Jubilee, were now covered with crape and white muslin, and immense black flags hung from their summits like eerie shadows. The sky had become overcast with dark drifting clouds, rain seemed imminent, and the black scowl of heaven harmonised with the soul- harrowing sorrow of the people. There was a great exhibition of peculiarly tasteful and appropriate expressions of the national sorrow — wreaths and other tokens in roses, laurels, palms, and crape. So numerous were the black flags floating from roofs, windows, and balconies, that all Vienna 34 S Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria appeared as though darkened by the countless wings of some mighty monster, enthroned aloft in undisputed power. Shortly after the body had arrived at the station, the Emperor and his two daughters, the Archduchesses Gisela and Valerie, left the palace at Schonbrunn, and started ofF in a closed Court carriage for the chapel at the imperial residence. The party arrived there shortly after the remains -had been placed on the bier, and all three knelt down before it, where they remained in prayer for some time. The appearance of the Emperor at his Vienna residence had been quite unexpected, and his last parting with her who had been dearer to him than life itself; was emotionally tragic. He had driven through by-ways and side-streets, and had arrived >yithin the precincts of the historical palace unnoticed by the countless multitudes who blocked the thorough- fares leading to the Hof burg. His Majesty stood erect and silent in the vestibule, where he was joined by Prince Leopold of Bavaria and the Archduke Francis Salvator, his son-in-law. From time to time he changed his position uneasily, raised his head higher, compressed his lips, and made evident but successfld efForts to subdue the terrible emotions which were struggling within him for the mastery. His two daughters, \' who were close by, were completely. over- Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 349 come and quite unable to restrain their tears. How long the brave old monarch would have been able to master his harrowing feelings it is impossible to con- jecture, but after a few minutes of most painful suspense the eight coffin-bearers ascended the stone Steps and approached the vestibule. Leaving his place, the Emperor drew near them ; and they, riveted to -the spot by the sudden apparition of the sorrowing monarch, stood still. This was one of the . most painfully dramatic scenes of the night — this sad and silent and final meeting after a short parting of the two who had been everything to each other. The Emperor remained motionless, as if rooted to the ground, his dry eyes fixed upon the plain dark brown coffin, his hands shut. Every person who took part in this r I moving scene, except perhaps the two Archduchesses, presented the appearance of figures cast from a mould, or of human beings thrown by some supernatural agency into a trance. After two or three minutes of this silent contempla- tion, the Emperor, raising his hand, gave the signal that the coffin should be taken to the chapel, he himself following with head erect, eyes dry, and the noble bearing which has ever \' been one of his principal characteristics. Princess Gisela had mastered her feelings to some extent, although she still continued to weep and sob ; but the Archduchess Valerie 3S^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria tottered, and had to be gently led by her husband. The members of the imperial family were followed by the personages who had accompanied the Empress\'s body from Switzerland, and then the ceremony of blessing the body began. The vested priest stood in the centre of the mediaeval chapel, which was draped in black. The coffin was laid on the bier before the altar, a large silver crucifix at the head, and four crowns, once worn by the murdered Empress, at the opposite end. During the simple but impressive rite, which lasted a quarter of an hour, the Emperor remained standing, while the august ladies knelt on frie-dieus. The words of the service, familiar to every Roman Catholic, and exceptionally so to the Emperor, struck, now that they were uttered on behalf of his beloved consort, upon the tenderest chords hidden deep in the sorrow-stricken heart, and the emotions he felt produced a twitching of the facial nerves, an uneasy movement of the fingers, a con- vulsive movement of the lips, which no eflFort could hide. The priest\'s voice grew more solemn and impressive ; and when at last he pronounced, in tearful tones, the name Elizabeth, Francis Joseph\'s eyes filled with tears, which ran in torrents down his cheeks, the gallant, erect bearing vanished, and he was now a sore-stricken, broken man, who stood weeping and sobbing in the presence of his murdered and beloved Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 3 5 1 wife. The monotonous tone of voice in which the sacerdotal blessing was continued exercised a calming effect upon the Emperor, who again recovered his apparent composure. This ceremony over, Count Bellegarde, the Chief Master of Ceremonies of the Empress, delivered up the keys of the coffin to Prince Liechtenstein, who occupies a similar position in the Emperor\'s Court. Francis Joseph, turning his eyes towards Prince Liechtenstein, saw the keys, and then, moving mechanically towards the coffin, like one in a dream, suddenly stretched out his arms towards the remains of the murdered Empress, and with a look of inexpressible anguish fell heavily upon his knees, and let his head fall upon the undraped lid of the coffin, which he passionately, convulsively, and repeatedly kissed, helplessly, hopelessly sobbing aloud the while. This extremity of grief, for which there is no medicine upon earth, affected every one present, and there was no longer a dry eye in the chapel ; the Archdukes, Prince Leopold, the priests, and servants all gave vent to their grief in tears. A few moments later everybody withdrew except the Emperor, his daughters, and his sons-in-law, who laid garlands on the bier, and then knelt down before the altar, where they remained five or six minutes in prayer. Rising from his place, the Emperor gave a sign that all were to retire. As he was leaving the chapel His 35^ Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria Majesty noticed Countess Sztaray, who had been the Empress\'s companion in her last travels. Turning to this lady, and speaking in a loud, clear, unfaltering voice, he said, "" Did Her Majesty suffer much ? "" ""I think not,"" was the reply ; ** for Her Majesty soon fell into a deep and painless sleep, and with but one sigh was released from life."" The Countess Sztaray seemed overcome by the painful reminiscence, and sank helpless on her knees. His Majesty took her hands and raised her up, after which all the persons who had taken part in this memorable drama retired. Upon the general desire of the people, the Emperor consented that the remains of his beloved wife should lie in state for two days in the imperial chapel, which is iti itself mediaeval and mystic, but much too small for such ceremonies as this, which had brought together no less than eighty princes, as well as countless throngs of people exhibiting signs of the greatest grief. The walls were draped in black, their sole ornament being the Empress\'s coat of arms, with the inscription, "" Elizabetha Imperatrix Austrae, 1898."" The atmo- sphere was heavy with the scent of numberless flowers, mingled with that of incense. In the centre of the chapel was a plain dark brown wooden coffin, without any pall, containing the metallic shell in which she who was lately the Empress of Austria and the Queen of Hungary sleeps her long last sleep. Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 3S3 \\ Slender green palms, tasteful garlands and wreaths, symbolical of mourning, of victory, of hope, filled the centre of the chapel, and formed a pleasant and reposeful contrast to the ubiquitous black. Two nuns were kneeling in silent prayer hke two wax figures, apparently lifeless. On the steps of the bier stood 23 354 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria four warriors, as motionless as statues ; they were the guard of honour, whose brilliant armour reflected the sea of light, whose waves inundated the little church. Marvellous and vision-like were the eflTects of the play of colours of the precious stones that ornamented the four crowns lately belonging to the murdered lady : the crown of Empress, first worn by Marie Theresa ; the crown of Queen, used at her coronation in Buda-Pesth more than thirty years ago ; the crown of Archduchess ; and that of Princess. On a cushion hard by were exhibited the nine decora- tions which Her Majesty possessed, conspicuous among them being the Order of the Sternkreutz and the Catherine Order of Russia ; and on another cushion were placed a pair of white gloves and a fan. Before the coffin only three wreaths were to be seen ; they had been laid there by the loving hands of the august lady\'s consort and children. The funeral took place on Saturday, the 17th, at four o\'clock in the afternoon. The streets through which the cortege passed were enveloped in a cloud of sable mourning, and looked like dismal corridors leading to some vast abode of the dead. Sorrow was the predominant note, even among those classes of society whose horizon seems usually circumscribed by the present and who are devoid of an outlook upon the future or the past. obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 355 Flowers were everywhere offered for sale — forget-me- nots, white roses, graceful lilies — all of them enveloped in transparent crape. The naked flames of the burners in the lamp-posts on the road served as torches, and the garish light burnt steadily in the breathless air from mid-day onwards. The grim silence of the crowds was continually broken by the clatter of gorgeous carriages, conveying the notabilities of Austria to the imperial palace ; kings and princes, field marshals and admirals, chancellors and prime ministers, cardinals, archbishops, and monks, followed each other in rapid succession, attired in a variety of uniforms, costumes, and robes, representative of past ages, and of many existing secular and religious institutions. At a quarter to four the body-servants of the deceased Empress removed the coffin from its standing- place, whereupon the Court chaplain recited once more the traditional blessing. After this the coffin was placed in the historic hearse, which, within the short span of a hundred years, has carried the remains of three Emperors and six Empresses from the Burg Capelle to the Capuchin Church. It was drawn by eight colossal raven-black steeds, over whose heads were nodding plumes of black ostrich feathers. The coffin, once laid on the richly carved hearse, which was surmounted by a black crown, was effectually hidden from view by the dense black falling drapery. The 35^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria coachmen and other attendants were dressed in black, and wore three-cornered hats over their white wigs. Not another light hue or colour was anywhere to be seen in their liveries. Everything in and near the hearse was as black as the four ebony pillars that supported the roof of the lugubrious vehicle. The funeral procession was led by Polish Uhlans, with drawn sabres glistening in the stray sunbeams that straggled athwart the floating black flags. Then came a rider attired in quaint costume, as black as the hearse. Another squadron of Uhlans, followed by another sable cavalier, and then a long line of mourning coaches, each one drawn by six black horses, conveyed the palace dignitaries, including those ladies who were in the service of the late Empress. This melancholy monotony of unchequered black was all at once succeeded by a vision of gay colours, such as might suit the day of a monster military review — cloths of gold and silver, stufl^s of scarlet, plumes of snowy horsehair, and polished steel, glistening in the sun. The palace guards, the body-guard riders, and others, with bright red, gold-spangled coats, battle-axes, and quaint headgear, rode onwards. Next appeared from beneath the triumphal arch a stream of yellowish light, proceeding from the flambeaux of the torch- bearers, who surrounded the imperial hearse. The vehicle of the dead was followed at some distance by T OF WHICH IS^THrTOHB OF THE HABSBURCS- Al\'.\'.H, I TilOIN huoiO*TiOSt I V •J <^ V. \'^ ^ Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 359 < brilliantly dressed cavaliers, hussars, and palace guards, ^ \\^ but not by the monarch himself, nor by any of his noble guests, all of whom had already left the Hof burg by a different route for the historic church of the Capuchin friars. The Capuchin Church is probably the plainest place of worship in all Vienna. Of very limited dimensions, ^ devoid of all architectural and other ornament, it was built in high-souled humbleness of heart by the Empress Anna, the consort of the Emperor Matthew, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, for the express \' purpose of serving as the burial-place of the members of the House of Habsburg. XThe distinguished lady \' who founded the monastery was the first whose remains were laid in the dismal vaults below, and the Empress- * Queen Elizabeth is the last but one who will be :. interred there, for there is now no room for more than a single coffin, that of the reigning Emperor, and even -^ before that can be laid in position the casket of the ,^ .

So soon as the hearse reached the little whitewashed church the body-servants of the Empress removed the pall and revealed the coffin to those who were near enough to see it. It is a narrow plain oaken shell, the corners bound with silver, and its only ornament is a silver cross on the lid. Every other member of the House of Habsburg was conveyed thither in a heavy massive coffin. The reason of this difference is that the coffin in which the Empress Elizabeth rests is a foreign shell, made under exceptional conditions. The moment it was raised aloft from the hearse the word of command was given to the soldiers, whereupon, to the beating of muffled drums, accompanied by the low tones of wind instruments, the lowering of crape- covered flags, and the presenting of sabres, the troops ofFered the last military honours to the illustrious dead. Meanwhile the coffin had been carried through the door into the. sombre church. This humble place of worship, which is never very bright, was literally covered with black cloth and crape, which served as a powerful foil to the white episcopal mantles in which the bishops were clad and the glittering gold of the ge ner m the circumscribed space allotted Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 361 to them in front of the high altar. In the midst of these ""spiritual shepherds"" stood Cardinal Archbishop Gruscha of Vienna, whose melancholy duty it was to pronounce the final benediction and utter the last solemn words. The Imperial Court Choir, whose voices were to accompany that of the Cardinal, and chant the thrilling Libera over the lifeless remains, was presided over by Hans Richter. Word having been brought to the Emperor, who, with the other members of the imperial house, was in the refectory of the Capuchin Monastery, His Majesty, in time to meet the coffin, entered the church by a side door to the right of the high altar at a few minutes past four. He was followed by the Emperor William and other monarchs, while the Crown Princess Stephanie and the two daughters of the Empress, enveloped in robes of mourning, moved forward. The Emperor manfully mastered his feelings. All eyes were riveted upon him as he stood erect in front of the coffin. At a short distance there was a long crape-covered bank, on which the Emperor William, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, and Kings Albert of Saxony, Charles of Roumania, and Alexander of Servia took their places in the order named. Opposite the Emperor Francis Joseph stood the Papal Nuncio. The subdued sounds of church bells and the tones of muffled drums which penetrated from without 362 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria suddenly ceased, and the silence was as that of the graves underneath. Then Cardinal Archbishop Gruscha, raising his voice, recited in solemn accents the funeral benediction, whereupon the choir chanted the traditional Libera^ which, being translated, means, "" Deliver me, O Lord, from everlasting death in that awful day when the heavens are to be shaken and the earth, and when Thou comest to judge the world."" The refrain, which contains the terrible words, "" Dies ira^ dies illie^^ is peculiarly impressive ; then comes the softer and more hopeful passage beginning, "" I am the resurrection and the life."" The last words were pronounced, and silence reigned once more. The Head Master of the Cere- monies, rising, approached the Emperor, and with a profound obeisance signified that the last and saddest moment had arrived — that of the eternal leave-taking from that which once was near and dear. The attendants lifted up the coffin, and the Emperor, with his daughters and sons-in-law, followed. The foreign princes bowed low as the mortal remains of the Empress were carried past them to the vault below. Signs of acute pain passed over the Emperor\'s countenance from time to time, but they vanished as rapidly, leaving no trace. Once, and once only, during the recital of the benediction, composed of Biblical texts, the natural echo of whose solemn oratory is a sigh, the monarch seenied on the point of breaking down ; but hi? iron Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 363 will maintained the mastery. Now, while he descended to the house of death below, fears were entertained that his energy would abandon him, and the silence was painful in the church, where every prince and priest and warrior listened for a tell-tale sound from the depths beneath. An eye-witness of what took place in those sub- terranean spaces declares that, when the coffin was laid in the provisional resting-place, the Emperor, accom- panied by Cardinal Gruscha and the Father-Guardian of the Capuchins, knelt down on a prie-dieu and prayed. The old Austrian custom is no longer observed of giving the body of a dead monarch to the Capuchin Church, the heart to the Augustinian Church, and the intestines to the Metropolitan Church of St. Stephen. The last personage whose mortal remains were thus divided was the Emperor\'s father. Archduke Francis Charles. The sorrowing Emperor, resting his head on the prie-dieUy remained silent and motionless for seven or eight minutes. Then the form of the prostrate monarch quivered, and choking sighs, subdued sobs, and half-suppressed moans were heard ; a cold con- vulsive shudder ran from man to man throughout the vaults, and the clergy, familiar with death in all its aspects and sorrow in all its degrees, wept and sobbed like children. 3^4 Elizabeth^ Empress of Austria A few seconds later the Emperor himself once more was seen entering the church. He signed to the Emperor William to precede him in leaving the house of worship. As he neared the door he cast a longing, lingering look in the direction of the gloom-girt vault, wherein sleep so many who have helped to make Austria\'s history, among whom the last will take a foremost place as one of the few of the dead whose works are active forces still and whose names burn bright as stars. Not for a long time after the departure of the Emperors did the other members of the illustrious company retire ; nor did the general public disperse until night had descended, with darkness denser than all the black flags of mourning. Soon after the funeral of the Empress, in reply to a question put by the Hungarian Prime Minister (Baron BanflFy), the Emperor said, "" Do not grudge me work. On the contrary, I am minded to work harder now — the one consolation that still is vouchsafed me."" Memorial services were held in almost all the capitals of Europe. The one in London took place at the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street, and was an extremely solemn and impressive ceremony ; the interior of the building was heavily draped with black cloth, and a cloth-covered catafalque was placed at the upper end of the nave near the sanctuary rails. The nave was reserved for the Corps Diplomatique and Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 365 others especially invited by the Austro-Hungarian Embassy. Among the foremost of the mourners were the Duke and Duchess of York, the former being in naval uniform, and the Duchess wearing black with a long veil of crape ; Princess Christian, attired in deep mourning ; and the Marquis and Marchioness of Lome. Representing Her Majesty the Queen, came the Earl of Pembroke ; while Lord Suffield, Colonel Egerton, and General Bateson attended on behalf of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke of Connaught, and the Duke of Cambridge. The Lord Mayor brought with him the sincere sympathies of the citizens of London. Needless to say, there was also a large gathering of diplomats ; each embassy sent its group of representa- tives. Russia, Spain, and Turkey were represented by the Ambassadors themselves. Portugal, Denmark, Belgium, Servia, Sweden, China, and Siani were all represented by their Ministers. In the absence of Count Hatzfeldt the delegates from the German Embassy were Count Hermann Hatzfeldt, Baron von Eckhardstein, and Herr von Oppell ; while for France M. GeofFray was present. The United States, Italy, Holland, Greece, Roumania, Japan, Peru, Chile, and Persia were also among the countries who had representatives present. Chopin\'s Funeral March and Beethoven\'s famous Funeral March on the death of a hero were rendered on the organ with great solemnity. 3^6 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria A funeral service was also held in Paris, at which H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, attired in the full uniform of his high military rank, was present. The President of the Republic, who, owing to the Cabinet Council at the Elysee, was unable to be present in person, was represented by General Hagron. Not the least interesting funeral service was the one held at St. Patrick\'s Chapel, Maynooth College. Thirty-three priests and six hundred and thirty students were present, as well as a number of neighbouring residents, including Sir Gerald Dease, Lady Dease and her sister, the Honourable Miss Throckmorton, who had been for many years attached to the suite of the late Empress of Austria, and many others. The signs of mourning were universal, the navies of the world hoisting their flags half-mast on the day of the funeral. This chapter may be closed with a short resume of Her Majesty\'s will, to which a peculiarly mournful interest is attached, as it was only completed three months before her death — namely, on the 20th of June, 1898 ; and it opens with the remarkable sentence, "" One never knows what may happen."" It is pretty well known that the Empress possessed a very large fortune and income in her own right, but it is not very generally known that Her Majesty\'s collection of jewels was not only unique but in many Obsequies in Vienna and Universal Mourning 367 respects considered to be one of the finest in Europe. A large portion of the collection, to the value, it is stated, of over ^600,000, is to be sold, and the proceeds are to be applied to various religious and charitable purposes. There are several special jewels which are to descend as heirlooms to the imperial family, amongst these being the Golden Rose presented to the Empress by Pope Pius IX. Nearly all that the Empress had in her own power to le.ive she bequeathed to her grand-daughter, the young Arch- duchess Elizabeth, daughter of the late Crown Prince Rudolf. ^5 CHAPTER XV. CONCL USION. 369 24 CHAPTER XV. CONCL US I ON. ""The grief that all hearts share grows less for one."" Sir Edwin Arnold {Light of Asia). SUCH a work as the present, which endeavours to delineate the character of a most admirable and unique woman, could hardly be deemed complete if it did not give at least a short sketch of the man to whom she was married, whom she loved with great sincerity, whom she admired, and to whom she has been all in all. Francis Joseph I., Emperor of Austria and Apostolic King of Hungary, was born in 1830, and ascended the throne of his ancestors on the 2nd of December, 1848. He is a grandson of Francis L, the father-in- law of Napoleon L, and therefore a nephew of the Empress Marie Louise. His mother was a Bavarian princess who was much in the hands of the Jesuits, and influenced his earlier education unhappily. The events of the memorable year 1 848 were too much for 371 37^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria the feeble-minded Emperor Ferdinand, who was then on the throne, and he abdicated ; his brother and heir declined to accept the vacant crown, and so he handed it on to his son, then eighteen years of age, young enough to be moulded to the new ideas. The early reign of the Emperor was full of troubles, worries, and vexations. The Hungarian revolt had to be suppressed, and he shared in person in the storming of Raab, a strong fortress in Hungary, at which time he received a slight wound. In the complicated struggles in Germany which followed the events of 1848 he joined Bavaria and Wiirtemberg in opposition to Prussia, and it was only due to the interposition of the Czar that war was prevented. In 1852 his life was attempted, but he was fortunately saved by his equerry and a citizen. In 1854, as we have seen, before he was twenty-four, he married his first cousin, the subject of our memoir, who was then a little more than sixteen years old. During the Crimean War the Austrian Emperor remained neutral, and was reproached with ingratitude by the Russians, as the Czar had helped him to put down the insurrection of Hungary five years previously. The New Year\'s Day of 1859 brought a shock to Europe that must have disturbed the Emperor Francis Joseph considerably. At the reception of the foreign Conclusion 373 ambassadors in Paris, Napoleon pointedly said to the Austrian representative that he regretted his relations with his master were unsatisfactory. A few weeks later war broke out between Austria and France in alliance with the then kingdom of Sardinia ; Austria being defeated, the Emperor made peace, conceding Lombardy to the new kingdom of Italy. At this time Germany was weary of its feeble confederation, which had become only nominal. Unification had been in the minds of all Germans for many years, but it had remained a dream because the smaller states were without power, and Austria and Prussia were opposed to and jealous of each other. At last in 1863 the Austrian Emperor, relying on his personal popularity, took a bold step : he sum- moned all the German rulers to meet him at Frank- fort-on-the-Main, where so many of his ancestors had been crowned, and asked them to discuss the future of Germany. With one exception all obeyed the summons of the scion of the Caesars, and it must indeed have been the proudest moment of Francis Joseph\'s life when he saw them rally round him. Unfortunately the exception was the King of Prussia, who had appointed Bismarck his Minister about this time, and who had remained deaf to the entreaties of the princes that he should join them. The conse- quence was that the meeting was abortive. 374 Elizabeth, Empress o( Austria At the end of the year came the war with Denmark, over a question which was popular with the German people. Although Austria had little interest in it, she could not refuse to take it up as Prussia did so, and she was obliged to join in the contest, lest her rival should have all the credit of fighting for a popular cause. Two provinces were taken from Denmark ; the victors quarrelled over the spoils, and the strife ended in the Seven Weeks\' War of 1866, in which the Austrian arms were most disastrously defeated. The Prussians came down from the North almost to the walls of Vienna, whilst the Italians attacked in the South. The peace which followed was made on terms that were most generous to the losing side : Austria lost Venice to Italy and recognised the supremacy of Prussia in the North German Confederation. In all this series of defeats neither Emperor nor people lost honour ; the Austrian armies were as ready to fight after defeat as before, and the people adhered to their unsuccessful Emperor with the same affection which in the subjects of Francis I. had excited the envy of Napoleon I. To the country itself the disasters proved beneficial ; the Emperor became a great con- stitutional reformer, and in this way he aflfbrds a most interesting instance of a man in whom such wide changes of ideas took place. As we have already mentioned, he was brought up at what was most Conclusion 375 probably the most bigoted Court in the world, under the iron rule of the Jesuits, proud and exclusive, absolute, autocratic, despotic to a degree — a Court where feudalism was paramount, and where the lower classes were looked upon as mere tools. The son of a weak father and a narrow-minded mother, he had become sovereign ot a great Empire when only eighteen years old, and within twenty years we see him one of the most enlightened monarchs, turning 37^ Elizabeth, Empress of Austria from feudalism and autocracy and becoming an abso- lutely liberal constitutionalist. With the exception of the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during which he was compelled to employ force, peace has reigned for many years in the realms of Francis Joseph, and he and his Govern- ment have made good use of it. The sovereign is second to our Queen in length of reign, but not in labour for the good of his people, and it would be a very difficult task to decide which of the two is the more popular amongst their subjects. The relations existing between Francis Joseph and Elizabeth through the forty-four years of their married life were most friendly, and no serious disturbances of their conjugal peace occurred. After the Empress had retired from Court life, and had taken up her abode more or less frequently abroad, her spouse visited her from time to time, and frequently spent weeks with her. On those occasions they were generally observed walking without any suite and engaged in most earnest conversation ; it may well be said that their mutual love and esteem lasted undiminished to the end of Elizabeth\'s life, and therefore we can well understand the unspeakable grief which has been caused to the venerable monarch by her violent death. But not popular only in his own country, this Conclusion 377 sovereign has won the esteem and love of most foreign countries, and the sympathy shown him in this his last terrible trial was so universal as to be entirely unique ; this is proved by the extraordinarily large assembly of foreign potentates and princes at the funeral obsequies of his wife. There stood the Emperor William of Germany, accompanied by General von Hanke ; and with a large suite the venerable King of Saxony. The Kings of Roumania and Servia ; the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Duke of Edinburgh) ; the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia ; the Prince Regent of Bavaria ; the Crown Prince Constantine of Greece ; the Crown Prince of Italy ; the Crown Prince Danelo of Montenegro ; Duke Nicholas of Wiirtemberg ; the Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe- Weimar, and he of Oldenburg ; Duke Charles Theodore of Bavaria, and his wife and daughters ; the Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden ; Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria ; Prince Albert of Belgium ; Prince Christian of Schleswig- Holstein, accompanied by Lord Denbigh (who is a scion of the House of Habsburg), as representative of Her Majesty the Queen of England; the Duke of Alen^on; and the Dukes Rupert and Christopher of Bavaria, were also present. The President of the French Republic was represented by General Faure-Biquet ; the Queen of Holland sent Baron Werner-Palland, and the King of Sweden Count Gyldenstolpe. The Duke 37 8 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria of Cumberland and the venerable Queen of Hanover, who both happened to be absent at the time, were also represented. There had arrived representatives from Brunswick, Schleswig-Holstein, and Hesse-Darmstadt ; and the German Chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, was present in person. It will be seen, when looking through the list of these illustrious personages, that there was an assembly of princes the like of which perhaps has never been seen in this world before. As a matter of course, too, the members of the imperial family were present. The Crown Prince\'s widow, with her daughter, the Archduchess Elizabeth, visited the coffin early on the day of its arrival in Vienna and laid wreaths upon it, the youthful daughter of Rudolf being so overwhelmed with grief that she had by force to be drawn away from the coffin. It would be impossible to enumerate the list of telegrams of condolence in this work. I have given some of the principal ones verbatim in the last chapter, and I may add that a very long one arrived from Pope Leo XIII., others from Queen Christina of Spain and the President of the Swiss Confederation. Besides these some were received from the German Empress ; the Queen of the Netherlands ; the Queen of Italy ; Sultan Abdul Hamid ; the Kings of Denmark Saxony, and Wiirtemberg ; the King of Portugal and Conclusion 3 8 1 his consort ; the King and Queen of Sweden ; the Mikado of Japan ; the Queen of Belgium ; the King and Queen of Greece ; the King of Siam ; the Grand Duke of Hesse ; the Grand Duke of Weimar ; the Grand Duke Peter of Oldenburg ; the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz ; Leopold, Prince Hohenzollern ; George, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen ; the Duke of Saxe- Altenburg ; the Prince of Montenegro ; the Princess of Bulgaria ; John of Mecklenburg ; Charles Gunther of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen ; the reigning Count of Lippe ; the Sultan of Zanzibar ; the Khedive of Fgypt ; the Presidents of the Republics of Peru, Uruguay, and Chile ; etc. It has been decided in various towns to erect memorials or monuments to the late Empress by public subscription. In Buda-Pesth a very large amount of money has already been collected for the purpose. The universal sympathy which was shown on the occasion to the bereaved monarch has no doubt been a source of great consolation to him, and he replied to all those who forwarded sympathetic addresses in words of sincere gratitude. I need only give the message received by the Lord Mayor of London in answer to the telegram sent to the Embassy — a letter from Count Albert von MensdorfF, Austro-Hungarian Charge d\' Affaires. 3^2 Elizabeth, Empress of Austria "" AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN EMBASSY, "" Belgrave Square, Sept ig/hj 1898. "" My Lord, — I have not failed to convey to His Majesty the Emperor and King, my august master, the kind expres- sion of condolence that your Lordship has sent to this Embassy on behalf of the City of London.

It shows the enormous sense of responsibility and duty of the deeply afflicted Francis Joseph that he expressed himself at once to the effect that he would attend to the State aflfairs without interruption. He left shortly after the funeral for a long stay with his daughter the Archduchess Marie Valerie at the Castle of Walsee, whence he went to Godolo in Hungary ; he remained absent for some time from Vienna, in order to regain the calm so necessary to him after his recent great distress of mind. Meanwhile the Emperor had given orders that the apartments of his late consort should remain undisturbed. I stated in a former chapter that the weapon of the murderer and the surgical instruments used by Conclusion 383 the Swiss physicians in making the post-mortem examination had been burnt in Geneva by order of Francis Joseph, who has acted in this in accordance with rule and old-worJd usage and tradition. It is a custom which is based partly on superstition, and partly on a determination to prevent articles of this kind from falling into the hands of dealers in curiosities, or being on exhibition in some more or less reputable museum. Although it has been impossible for me in this memoir to do full justice to the dead Empress, yet I hope that I have succeeded in giving a sufficiently true sketch of her late Majesty to show that, whatever may have been her eccentricities, her character was one of the most lovely and noble this century has seen. She is dead, but her memory will live for ever. Printed by Hazell, Watson, ft Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury.

McClurg & Co. 1909 Published August 21, 1909 THE UNIVERSITY PRESS, CAMBRIDGE, U.S.A. v Translator’s Preface The story of the life of Elizabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, is one of the saddest in the history of royalty, and in some respects recalls the story of the life of Marie Antoinette. Both their lives were sorrowful, both ended tragically, the one at the hands of an assassin, the other upon the guillotine. Elizabeth will not be remembered in history as a sovereign, for everything connected with the throne and with court life was distasteful to her, but rather as the beautiful, sorrowful daughter of the Wittelsbachs. She was not only one of the most beautiful women of her time, but an accomplished scholar and linguist, a good musician, and well versed in history, science, and art. She was a passionate lover of the woods and mountains, and was happiest when she was walking or riding among them, or associating with the Hungarian people. She was no more at home with the Viennese than was Marie Antoinette with the Parisians. Her domestic life was saddened by estrangement from her husband, by lack of sympathy among her relatives, by the terrible tragedy which ended the life of her son, Prince Rudolph, and by other tragedies which involved the happiness and sometimes the lives of those nearest to her. At last her sufferings were ended by the dagger of a cruel anarchist assassin. As the author of this volume says: “She died as she had often wished to die, swiftly and painlessly and under the open sky. Who can say that her last breath was not a sigh of thankfulness and peace?” G. P. U.

Maximilian Joseph, the head of the ducal line of Vorpfalz-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, and his wife Ludovica (Louise), daughter of King Maximilian First of Bavaria and his second wife, Caroline of Baden, celebrated on that day their diamond wedding, both bride and groom having been barely twenty years old at the time of their marriage. 12 Few princely couples have been closely connected with so many of the reigning families of Europe. Their eldest son, Ludwig Wilhelm, renounced the succession to wed an actress, Henrietta Mendel, who had received the title of Countess Wallersee. Helene, the eldest daughter, married the Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis, and their daughter Louise, by her alliance with Frederick of Hohenzollern, formed new ties between the Wittelsbachs and the royal house of Prussia. The next daughter was Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary, whose son in his turn took for his bride the King of Belgium’s daughter, Stephanie. After Elizabeth, in the family, came Karl Theodore, well known as an oculist, and, on his father’s death, the head of the ducal line of Wittelsbach. He first married his cousin Sophie, daughter of King John of Saxony; the second and present wife is Marie Josepha, Princess of Portugal. Two other daughters, Marie and Mathilde, allied themselves with the younger branch of the Bourbons. Marie became the wife of King Francis Second of Naples and Mathilde married his half-brother, Count Louis of Trani. The youngest daughter, Sophie, was betrothed at one time to her cousin, King Ludwig Second of Bavaria, but afterwards married Duke Ferdinand d’Alençon, nephew of Louis Philippe of France, while the youngest son, Max Emanuel, married Amélie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, thereby becoming connected by marriage with Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria. 13 The Wittelsbachs have always been eccentric. Mental disorders have been common with them, and during the last century between twenty and thirty members of the family have died insane. Yet in spite of their peculiarities and eccentricities they have always been exceedingly popular with their subjects, as much for their personal charm as for their devotion to the happiness and welfare of their people. The annals of Bavaria have little to record of treason or conspiracy against the princes of the land, but tell much of the loyalty and sacrifices of life and property on the part of the people. Duke Maximilian Joseph was born at Bamberg, December 4, 1808. He was the son of the weak-minded Duke Pius Augustus of Bavaria and his wife, Amélie Louise, Princess of Arenberg. “The good Duke Max,” as he was called by the people, was the only direct descendant of his grandfather, while his wife, on the other hand, was the youngest of a large family of sisters. Two had been princesses of Saxony and one a Queen of Prussia, while the fourth was the mother of the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary. King Ludwig First of Bavaria was a half-brother, and there were also two half-sisters. One was married first to the King of Würtemberg and afterwards to the Emperor Francis First of Austria-Hungary; the other became the wife of Napoleon’s stepson, Eugene Beauharnais, and the grandmother of Kings Charles Fifteenth and Oscar Second of Norway and Sweden. 14 Thus most of the dynasties of Europe were interested in the festivities in honor of the aged pair, and sent congratulations to the secluded spot on Starnberg Lake, where the event was celebrated, and where many touching proofs of the loyalty of the people of Bavaria were also received. Maximilian Joseph belonged to the most eccentric and popular branch of the Bavarian royal family. Educated directly under the eye of his grandfather, his childhood had been spent partly in Bamberg, partly in Munich. At the age of eighteen he entered the University of Munich, where he applied himself assiduously to the study of history, natural science, and political economy, and on coming of age he was given, as provided by the Bavarian constitution, a seat in the Senate chamber. But he did not aspire to fame, either as orator or statesman; nor did he strive for military distinction, though at the age of thirty he was assigned to the command of a regiment of cavalry and in 1857 was invested with the rank of general. His natural love for science, literature, and art more often led him to exchange his uniform for the simple civilian dress. 15 During the youth of the Duke a musician, named Johann Petzmacher, created a great stir. He was born in 1803, the son of an innkeeper in Vienna, and in his eighteenth year accidentally learned to play the homely zither with which the mountaineers of the Austrian and Bavarian highlands accompany their folk songs. He soon became so absorbed in the possibilities of this instrument that he gave up everything else to devote himself to it. His fame as a performer soon spread far and wide. He played before the most select circles of Vienna and even at court, and made tours throughout Germany, being received everywhere with the greatest enthusiasm. Duke Max first heard him in 1837 at a concert in Bamberg, and determined to learn to play the zither under the master’s direction. Petzmacher was introduced to the would-be virtuoso, and from that time until his death made his home with his art-loving patron. The Duke in 1838 undertook a long journey through Asia and Africa, and his musician friend accompanied him. Savages listened with delight to his playing, and as the two friends sat on the top of the Egyptian pyramids or camped in the hot desert sands, the homely melodies carried their thoughts back to loved ones in Germany, and dangers and hardships were forgotten. While on this journey Duke Max wrote several musical compositions which were afterwards performed in public and received with great applause. Under the name of “Phantasus,” he wrote a collection of dramatic poems and novels that showed no small literary talent. More noteworthy than these, however, is his “Travels in the Orient,” a book of considerable merit. On his return to Bavaria he had a circus ring constructed in the rear of his palace in the Ludwigstrasse, at Munich, which aroused much curiosity, where he frequently made his appearance as ringmaster with members of the Bavarian nobility as circus riders and performers. 16 It was only during the winter months that he remained in Munich. All through the Summer and Autumn he lived with his family at his castle Possenhoffen, beautifully situated on Lake Starnberg. This picturesque region, shut in by a chain of lofty Alps, seems as if created to inspire poetical sentiment, and various members of the art-loving Bavarian royal family have built summer palaces there. 17 Max Joseph was an enthusiastic hunter and spent whole days roaming through the forests and mountains about Possenhoffen. Enjoyment of the beauties of nature was one of his passions, and he often came out in the Winter for a few days at a time. On these excursions he wore a simple hunting costume,—short gray jacket, open shirt with suspenders, feathered cap, knickerbockers with long stockings, and heavy-soled shoes. He generally went about on foot, but sometimes made use of the mail-coach, the usual mode of conveyance at that time. His fellow travellers seldom suspected that the good-natured huntsman who chatted so freely with them was a duke and the brother-in-law of their sovereign. He was continually besieged with petitions, and rarely did any one appeal in vain to the comparatively poor but warm-hearted prince. His benevolence was one of the chief causes for his popularity in Munich, though he was most beloved by the people as the gay zither player who with his instrument under his arm would enter their cottages quite like one of themselves, and play for the young people who were never weary of dancing to his music. 18 His wife was very different. She had not his artistic, impulsive temperament, and the good-humored simplicity with which he mingled with the common people did not altogether meet with her approval. The proper maintenance of her position seemed no more than a duty due to her high birth and rank, and for this reason she was never as popular as her husband, though her many admirable qualities commanded the greatest respect and admiration during the sixty years that she remained mistress of Possenhoffen. She was naturally endowed with a good mind and had been carefully educated. Honesty and love of truth were among her most marked characteristics, and all her life she held firmly to what after mature reflection she believed to be right. Like the Duke, she preferred the seclusion of the country to city life, and all through their happy married life she acted as a balance to her loving but restless husband as well as friend and adviser of her children, who adored and looked up to her always. Her glance was keen but kindly. Smiles came easily to her lips, and there was an air of distinction about her that sprang from true nobility of heart. She was one of those strong souls born to help others, but in little need of support themselves. She was by no means unambitious for her children, though the trials suffered because of them taught her by degrees to place less value upon outward splendor. She disliked to excite personal attention and cared only to live as quietly and modestly as possible. 19 Chapter II Birth and Childhood of Elizabeth of Bavaria It was the Christmas Eve of 1837. The bells of Munich were proclaiming the festival when Max Joseph, wandering about in one of the poorer quarters of the city, met a woman dragging herself painfully toward him with a bundle of firewood on her back. She addressed him with the usual Bavarian greeting, “Praised be Jesus Christ!” “For ever and ever, Amen!” replied the Duke, adding kindly, “Why are you carrying such a load upon your back this holy Christmas Eve?” “I will tell you why, gracious Duke,” said the woman; “it is because my children have no Christmas gifts, and I have been in the forest gathering wood so that they may at least enjoy a warm room.” “You did right,” returned the Duke. “As for me, I have already received my Christmas gift, for my wife presented me to-day with a charming little daughter who is to be called Liese, and I am so happy over it I wish you too to have a Merry Christmas.” 20 He wrote her name and address in his notebook, and after the darkness had fallen two servants appeared at the poor woman’s dwelling with two heavy baskets filled with food. At the bottom of each was a banknote for a considerable sum. The child born on this day was Elizabeth, afterward Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. In many countries it is regarded as a sign of misfortune to be born on Christmas Eve, but the happy childhood of the little princess had no foreshadowing of the experiences of her after life. Most of her early years were spent at Possenhoffen, which her father had bought some time before her birth. The great park and surrounding forests were the child’s first playgrounds, and developed in her sensitive soul a deep love of nature and of freedom. The Duchess’s chief concern was the education of her eldest daughter, of whom she had great hopes. Helene was nearly four years older than her sister and was the favorite of the mother, whom she resembled both in character and appearance. Overshadowed by her seemingly superior talents, with no interest in books and ignorant of the requirements of court life, Elizabeth—or “Sissi,” as she was called—grew up almost unnoticed. She loved her sister with the enthusiasm of youth and with the natural tendency of the ignorant to look up to those more clever than themselves, but her father and brothers were dearer to her than either sister or mother. 21 The little girl was the darling of the Duke. She had inherited his love of nature, roamed about constantly with him through the mountains, visiting the peasants’ huts, and learned to look at life and people through his eyes. Her bringing up in no way fitted her for the high station she was afterward to occupy. At the end of her fifth year she was given a governess, but “Sissi,” though an unusually gentle and lovable child, soon learned how to wind her teacher round her finger and concerned herself little about study, for which she had no love. The Empress used to declare that in her youth she was the most ignorant princess in Europe, and the little she did know had been learned as she sat on her father’s knee. But if not over-taxed with lessons, her education in other branches was by no means neglected. The Duke was determined that his children should be well developed physically, and one of the best dancing masters of the time was summoned to Possenhoffen to teach Elizabeth and her sisters to dance and carry themselves properly. Even in her later years the Empress was an excellent walker and famous for her easy, graceful carriage. 22 “Walking never tires me,” she said once to one of her attendants, “and I have my father to thank for it. He was an indefatigable hunter and wanted my sisters and myself to be able to leap and spring like the chamois.” She also learned to swim and ride and dearly loved to sit a horse and feel the wind blowing through her hair. She was never happier than when riding about Lake Starnberg on her little pony, and in the winter, when forced to stay in the capital, it was her greatest joy to escape to the stables, where she would mount the most unmanageable horses that could be found. One day while playing circus, as she often did, she was thrown by a wild, full-blooded animal. Her governess uttered a shriek of terror, but Elizabeth quickly rose to her feet, neither frightened nor hurt, and laughingly besought permission to mount the horse again, which the terrified governess refused to grant. The happiest time in the whole year to her was when the warm spring days made it possible for them to return to Possenhoffen and she could enjoy unlimited freedom once more. She was passionately fond of flowers, and it is still told among the Bavarian Alps how “Liese of Possenhoffen” used to scramble about the wild unbeaten mountain paths to return at last with her arms full of edelweiss. 23 Her father taught her to play the zither, and she often went with him on long tramps among the Alps, stopping now and then for rest and refreshment at some hut where they would play dance music on their own instruments or on some they found there. On one occasion they had done this in a remote region where the huntsman and his daughter were not known, and the people gave the pretty child a piece of money in payment. Elizabeth always kept it. “It is the only money I ever earned,” she once said, when showing it to an acquaintance. There was never much pocket money for her to buy presents with, and she used often to spend the evenings knitting stockings for her mountain friends or sewing on some piece of needlework. The country folk about Possenhoffen idolized the little Liese, and when overtaken by one of the autumn storms she would often take refuge in their huts, quite alone, and sit down by the fire to chat and laugh with old or young. Her parents saw nothing amiss in this. Duke Max liked nothing better than to enter into the lives of his people, and when the mother was told how her daughter ran about with her brothers or played the zither in hovels while the peasants danced she but smiled indulgently, saying: “She is only a child. I will take her education in hand later on.” 24 This free life at Possenhoffen taught the little Elizabeth to regard the woods and mountains as her second home, and the most splendid halls of the palace seemed small and stifling to her in comparison. It no doubt exerted a marked influence on her later development, and possibly furnished a clue to her character as Empress of Austria. Had her childhood been different, she would unquestionably have been better fitted for the position she was soon to occupy. 25 Chapter III Betrothal of Princess Elizabeth One of the first journeys Elizabeth made with her parents and sisters was to Ischl. It was there that Franz Joseph’s parents were in the habit of spending the summer months, and the two sisters, the Archduchess Sophie and the Duchess Ludovica, had agreed to meet here in the Summer of 1853. The five years that had passed since the Emperor’s accession to the throne had been years of struggle and anxiety. Only a few months before, he had been wounded by the dagger of an assassin. The internal disorders of the Empire, however, had not prevented his name from being linked with that of various European princesses,—reports which were finally silenced by his clever and strong-willed mother, who swayed him completely and had determined that a princess of her own house should share her son’s double throne. This was natural enough. Both the Wittelsbachs and Hapsburgs are among the oldest reigning families of Europe, both have remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, and for six hundred years alliances between them have been common. 26 The Archduchess had heard much of the talent and amiability of her sister’s daughter Helene. She and the Duchess Ludovica were on the best of terms and had already secretly decided on the marriage. It only remained for the young people to meet and take a fancy to each other,—a matter of some concern to the Emperor, who, though an obedient son, was also a passionate admirer of the fair sex. It was certainly mutual attraction that drew Franz Joseph and Elizabeth together, though there are many tales told of how their betrothal came about. The following account, however, is probably nearest the truth. On the sixteenth of August, 1853, the Emperor went to visit his parents at Ischl and meet Max Joseph’s family. As the travelling carriage rolled along the dusty highway, his adjutant suddenly uttered a cry of admiration: “Look, your Majesty, look yonder!” Franz Joseph drew out his field glass and caught a glimpse of a beautiful child playing with a flock of goats on a meadow near by. The next instant the road turned and the town appeared in sight. 27 An hour later he was sitting with his mother when a young girl burst into the room, unannounced, with a bunch of wild roses in her hand. She wore a short white frock, and a mass of silky chestnut hair fell in soft waves about her slender figure. It was the same youthful beauty he had seen from the carriage. It was the first time they had met, but she recognized him at once from the portraits she had seen, and without a trace of embarrassment approached and greeted him, saying heartily: “How do you do, cousin?” “Who are you?” inquired the Emperor, almost fearing lest the lovely apparition might vanish before his eyes. “I am Elizabeth!” The smile in the wonderful blue eyes won his heart upon the spot. A few hours later he was presented to the Princess Helene, who, if not beautiful, was a bright, intelligent-looking girl with an air of great distinction. Had not Franz Joseph seen Elizabeth first, Helene would undoubtedly have become his Empress. The same day he was to dine with his aunt and uncle. As he entered their hotel in Ischl, he heard two voices from behind a half-closed door. “I beg of you not to go out, Princess!” said one; “you know it has been forbidden.” 28 “That is the very reason why I want to,” retorted the other in soft girlish tones which he recognized; and the next moment Elizabeth stood before him, all smiles and blushes. “Why must you not go out?” he asked. “Because I am only a child and am not expected to appear till my older sister is married. It is all your fault, and I shall have to eat by myself, too!” “Princess, what are you thinking of?” cried the governess, who now made her appearance, crimson with anger. “Pardon, your Majesty!” she added, turning to the Emperor, “but I have had strict orders.” Without heeding her, he offered his arm to the young girl. “Let us go out together, cousin,” he said. “No, no, I dare not!” she replied in alarm. “Papa would be furious.” “Come back!” cried the governess, and taking advantage of her pupil’s momentary hesitation, she drew her into the room and closed the door with a low courtesy to the Emperor. At the close of the meal Franz Joseph turned to the Duke. “I have a favor to ask of my kind host,” he said. “Is it not the custom in Bavaria for the children to come in after dinner? I would like to become better acquainted with your second daughter, whom I saw for a moment at my mother’s this morning.” 29 All exchanged glances, and there was a moment’s silence, as Duchess Ludovica felt all her hopes for Helene slipping away. The Duke replied: “It shall be as you wish, your Majesty,” and in a few moments Elizabeth made her appearance, blushing and frightened. Franz Joseph had not a high opinion of women as a rule. Young as he was, he had already had some experience of them, but this lovely, innocent child wrought a sudden change in him, and through the political clouds that darkened the first years of his reign love flashed like lightning into his heart. That evening the Archduchess Sophie gave a ball at which both nieces were present. The court, suspecting that fateful events were brewing, watched the Bavarian princesses curiously. The Archduchess showed marked favor to Helene; the son devoted himself to both. When during the cotillion he handed Elizabeth a magnificent bouquet of roses, the interest increased. Would the mother yield to the son, or the son give way to the mother? 30 Franz Joseph’s choice was already made, however, and at the close of the ball he announced that he would have no one but Elizabeth for his wife. The Archduchess’ surprise and chagrin at the failure of her cherished plan knew no bounds, but she determined not to oppose her son’s choice. She had wanted him to marry her other niece, hoping to rule her as she did him; if the crown were to go to an immature child of sixteen instead of her clever sister of twenty, no doubt it would be so much the easier. At nine o’clock the next morning the royal carriage stopped before Max Joseph’s door. The Emperor hastened up the steps, asked for an interview with the Duke and the Duchess, and then and there made a formal request for the hand of Princess Elizabeth. This was an affront to Helene that neither her father nor her mother found it easy to endure, but the suitor was persistent. If he could not have the one he loved, then he would not marry at all, and at length they were forced to yield. Franz Joseph wanted Elizabeth to be notified at once, but they would not consent to force her in any way. She was still as much a child in heart and feeling as in appearance, and when first told of the Emperor’s wishes she clasped her hands in dismay, exclaiming: “It is impossible! I am much too young!” Love had entered her dreams, however, even if her heart was not yet awakened. Franz Joseph’s impetuous wooing appealed to her impulsive nature. She was attracted by his person and his temperament, and without pausing to reflect, she joyfully promised to be his wife. The betrothal took place on the Emperor’s twenty-third birthday, August 18, 1853. 31 Great were the public rejoicings when the news reached Vienna. The glamour of romance that enveloped the affair appealed to the popular fancy, and a thousand tales were woven about the lovely child who was to be the bride of their young sovereign. Her pictures were scattered broadcast throughout the Empire, and people were never weary of dwelling on her beauty and the simple home life of her early days. During the month that the betrothed pair remained at Ischl with their parents, crowds flocked thither daily to gaze upon their future Empress, and returned full of praises of her modesty and charm. 32 Chapter IV The Wedding Ceremonies On the twentieth of April, 1854, Elizabeth, accompanied by her parents and her two oldest sisters, started on her bridal journey to Vienna. Peasants from all the surrounding country thronged the streets of her native city through which she passed, and, overcome with the grief of parting, she stood up in her carriage and waved a tearful farewell to the cheering crowds. The steamboat Stadt Regensburg conveyed the party from Straubing to Liutz. Work was everywhere suspended as on a holiday, and nothing was thought of but the coming of the long-awaited princess. At Liutz they had to go ashore to change boats, and there Franz Joseph met them, hurrying back to Vienna, however, so as to be there to welcome his bride. The town was buried in flowers. A magnificent arch had been erected. Bonfires burned on all the surrounding heights, while torchlight processions, theatrical performances, and serenades concluded the festivities of the day. 33 The next morning, April 22, the journey down the Danube was resumed. The Franz Joseph, which carried them from Liutz to Mussdorf, was covered with roses from stem to stern, the cabin hung with purple velvet, and the deck transformed into a flower garden. It was a beautiful spring morning. Banners waved from every roof and tower, and the river banks were lined on either side with cheering throngs, eager to catch a glimpse of their future Empress. What they saw was a slender, white-robed figure hastening from one side of the vessel to the other and bowing continually in response to the storms of greeting of which she never seemed to tire. 34 Meanwhile, at Mussdorf, the landing place for Vienna, great preparations had been made to welcome her. Since early morning crowds had been flocking thither, waiting with imperturbable patience and struggling to keep the places so hardly won. Near the bridge a pavilion had been erected with a wide portico whose gilded turrets and cupolas gleamed afar, and by noon it was filled with nobles, prelates, high officials, and deputies from the middle classes. Stationed upon a terrace to the right were the foreign ambassadors with their ladies; on the left sat representatives from Vienna and other cities under the Hapsburg rule. The weather had been threatening in the early part of the day, but towards noon heavy gusts of wind scattered the clouds, leaving the bluest of skies to welcome the bridal party. At half-past six the boat touched the shore amid the booming of cannon, strains of music, and the solemn pealing of bells. Franz Joseph hastened forward to embrace his bride, closely followed by his parents, the Archduke Franz Karl and the Archduchess Sophie, who embraced Elizabeth and then led her back to the bridegroom. At last came the long-awaited moment when Elizabeth, leaning on the Emperor’s arm, entered the Austrian capital. From thousands of throats came the shout, “Long live the Emperor’s bride!” The sound was so overwhelming that Elizabeth stood for some moments by her lover’s side as if spellbound; then, as her glance swept slowly over the excited throng, she smiled charmingly and waved her handkerchief to the delighted spectators. Many years have passed since that day, many misfortunes have overtaken Austria and the house of Hapsburg, but eyewitnesses are still living who remember that moment and tell of the picture the fair young princess made as she then appeared in all her exquisite loveliness. 35 EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH in his twenty-eighth year The progress from Mussdorf to Schönbrunn was a continuous ovation. At half-past seven they reached the gates of the old palace, where the Emperor once more bade his bride welcome before leading her up the great staircase, which was decorated from top to bottom with tropical plants and flowers. On the following day the state entry into Vienna took place. Every house had been decorated by loving hands, and the streets through which the bride was to pass were perfect rivers of flowers. The Elizabeth Bridge, which connected Vienna with the suburb of Wieden or “An der Wien,” was opened that day and given the name of the Empress.[1] Here the mayor and council of the city were stationed to welcome her. About the eight statues of famous men which adorned the bridge, thousands of rare shrubs and blossoms from the hothouses of Princes Lichtenstein and Schwarzenberg, the fragrance of which filled the whole town, had been effectively arranged. As far as the Corinthian gate stretched a triple wall of citizens, and at short intervals young girls stood strewing flowers. 36 The thunder of cannon and pealing of bells from every church tower in Vienna and its suburbs proclaimed the starting of the procession. The golden state coach was drawn by eight milk-white horses with tall white plumes on their heads; the harnesses were covered with gold, and the coachman, footmen, and postilions wore white wigs. On the back seat sat the bride with her mother. Her dress was of red satin, embroidered in silver, and over it she wore a white cloak trimmed with garlands of roses. About her neck was a lace handkerchief, and in her beautiful hair sparkled a circlet of diamonds, twined in which was a wreath of red roses. Never had Elizabeth more fitly deserved the name so often given her, never had she more perfectly looked “The Rose of Bavaria.” Early on the morning of April 24, 1854, Te Deums were celebrated in all the churches of Vienna and the august pair attended high mass in the court chapel. By three o’clock in the afternoon the crowds about the Hofburg and the Church of the Augustins, where the ceremony was performed, were so great that barriers had to be erected to keep a way clear for the coaches to pass. From all parts of the Empire and of Europe guests had been pouring into the capital. On the preceding day alone, seventy-five thousand strangers arrived, a most extraordinary number for those days. Even the Orient—Alexandria, Smyrna, and Salonica—sent representatives to the wedding. 37 The famous old Church of the Augustins was gorgeously decorated for the occasion. Above the high altar rose a canopy of white velvet embroidered with gold, under which were placed two prie-dieux, also of white velvet. The walls and columns of the church were hung with damask and costly tapestry and the floor was carpeted. From a hundred candelabra countless tapers shed a soft but brilliant light. The Augustin Gallery, which led from the inner apartments of the Hofburg to the church, was similarly decorated and illuminated. The marriage was to take place at seven o’clock in the evening. By six every available space in the church was filled with invited guests. The gay uniforms of the officers, the many-colored and picturesque court dresses of the Hungarian and Polish nobles, the sparkling jewels of the ladies, the gold-embroidered coats of the ministers and distinguished guests, the red robes of the cardinals, the fantastic costumes of many of the Oriental emissaries, all united to form a scene of incredible magnificence. At the appointed time Prince Archbishop Rauscher, the Emperor’s former tutor, with more than seventy bishops and archbishops in their gold-embroidered vestments, assembled in the sacristy. The master of ceremonies informed his Majesty that all was ready, and the procession entered the Augustin Gallery. First came the pages, stewards, and gentlemen-in-waiting; next the privy councillors and high court officials; then the Archdukes with their chamberlains; and, last of all, the Emperor himself, in the uniform of a field marshal and wearing all his orders. Directly behind the bridegroom came his mother, leading the bride on her left. On Elizabeth’s left was her own mother, Duchess Ludovica, and after them followed the ladies of the court led by the Lord Chamberlain. 38 The bride of sixteen was radiant with all the beauty and happiness of youth. Her wedding gown was of heavy white silk, richly embroidered with gold and silver, over which she wore a loose garment of the same material with long sleeves. A diamond clasp held the long veil of Brussels point lace, and the bridal wreath of fresh myrtle and orange blossoms was secured by a magnificent coronet of diamonds which her mother-in-law had worn at her own marriage and given to Elizabeth as a wedding gift. A diamond necklace encircled her throat, and upon her breast she wore the Bavarian order of Theresa and the Austrian order of the Starry Cross, together with a bunch of white roses. 39 The Emperor and his bride were met at the door of the church by the Prince Archbishop, who sprinkled them with holy water, after which they knelt on the prie-dieux while the other members of the two royal families took their places. After a short prayer Franz Joseph and Elizabeth advanced to the high altar, made their responses, exchanged rings, and clasped hands. As the Archbishop pronounced the Church’s blessing at the close of the ritual, a salvo of musketry sounded from the regiment of infantry stationed on the Josephsplatz, and the next instant the thunder of cannon proclaimed that Austria had an Empress and Hungary a Queen. 40 Chapter V First Troubles At the time of her marriage Elizabeth was said to be not only the youngest but also the most beautiful Empress that had ever sat on the throne of the Hapsburgs. Her figure was tall and slender, her hands and feet small and well shaped, her features regular and delicate. She had a charming smile, wonderfully expressive dark blue eyes, a beautiful complexion, and a mass of waving chestnut hair that fell about her, when loosened, like a veil, and which she wore either hanging in eight heavy braids or wound like a coronet around her head. With no experience of the world and full of the confidence of youth, she looked forward to her married life as one long holiday. Crowned with love, all hearts should bow before her and she would be the good genius of her people. 41 But disappointment followed close upon the heels of the first intoxication. If the lower classes were charmed with their Empress, this was far from being the case with an aristocracy that claims to be the most exclusive in Europe, and there were many at court who felt that neither by age nor rank was this daughter of a non-royal Duke fitted to be their sovereign. Instead of being welcomed with open arms, therefore, she encountered only a wall of opposition and intrigue. Far from being the brilliant centre of homage and admiration, as she had dreamed, she was grieved and mortified to find those about her anxious only to deprive her of the honors and influence that were her due. It was most unfortunate that she should have been placed so early in a position requiring the utmost tact and knowledge without having had any training to fit her for it,—a poor bird that had left the home nest before it had learned to fly! In Bavaria she had been a happy, care-free child, beloved by every one and so full of the joy of life that she seemed to carry with her wherever she went a breath of those woods and mountains she so dearly loved. A Wittelsbach by both lines of descent, she had inherited the characteristics of the race, their pride and independence, honesty and courage, to a striking degree. Even these virtues, however, were but so many dangers, since they made it difficult for her to adapt herself to the rules laid down by court life. Her very youth and freshness were out of place at Schönbrunn and the Hofburg. Her ignorance and inexperience, which were well known in Vienna, made it seem probable that she would prove an easy tool at court, provided she were only amused and flattered sufficiently. But this error was soon discovered. With the peculiarities of her race she had also inherited their marked mental gifts, and young as she was, her mind was quick to grasp whatever interested her and to choose or reject with certainty. 42 Such a nature could not but rebel against the restraint and monotony of court life. Its pomps and ceremonies wearied her from the first, and little as she resembled Marie Antoinette in other ways, she hated etiquette even more than did that unfortunate Queen. The court of Vienna, which had lived by its conventional usages from time immemorial, regarded as natural and necessary the forms that Elizabeth considered ridiculous and childish. She once aroused a storm of indignation by refusing to appear at the customary state breakfast, which consisted of various hot dishes, and ordering some bread and sausage and a glass of Munich beer to be brought to her in her own apartments. On another occasion, when presiding at one of her first court ceremonials, she took off her gloves, contrary to all custom and tradition. An elderly court dame hastened to remind her of her mistake. “Why should I not?” inquired the Empress. “Because it is against the rules of etiquette,” was the answer. 43 “Then in future let it be proper to break the rule!” she declared. No young husband could have been more devoted than Franz Joseph was to the bride he had found for himself without the aid of ambassador or envoy. “I am beloved as if I were a lieutenant, and as happy as a god!” he wrote to a friend just after the wedding. And Elizabeth did truly love him, but not as he did her. In spite of the intensity of feeling that showed itself in after life, there was a certain inborn coldness in her nature that made it impossible for her to share his ardor or to understand him always. But it often taxed his devotion and patience to reconcile this freedom-loving child of nature to the restraints and obligations of her new position, and he was many times called upon to make peace between the older court ladies and their young mistress. He would gladly have loosened her bonds somewhat, but dared not introduce new ways and customs. 44 The Archduchess Sophie had hitherto reigned supreme at court. She was a remarkably clever woman, and all through the first difficult years of her son’s reign had proved a valuable support to him, and acquired an influence which she had no intention of surrendering into the hands of her seventeen-year-old niece. Two women, though of the same blood, could scarcely have been more different. The Archduchess was ambitious and worldly; the Empress cared nothing for place or power. Sophie was completely under the influence of the priesthood; Elizabeth worshipped God in nature, but avoided all religious ceremonies and hated priests. The older woman expected to find it easy to govern this child who had so unexpectedly received the imperial crown, through her vanity and inexperience, but finding herself mistaken, she resorted to other means. Elizabeth, as we have seen, had come to Vienna full of hopes and dreams, expecting naturally to occupy the first place in her husband’s life and court; but every attempt to assert her right as Empress was deliberately set aside by the Archduchess, who crushed her hopes and dispelled her dreams with a cruel hand, regardless of her feelings. 45 As for the court, “Madame Mère,” as she was called, was a power whose friendship it was prudent to possess. It was believed, moreover, that Franz Joseph, whose fickleness and susceptibility in matters of the heart were well known, would soon tire of his young wife. Elizabeth’s inexperience made it impossible for her to battle successfully with court intrigues, and it was plain that the mother-in-law would be victorious in the struggle between them. The Emperor always treated his wife with the greatest care and consideration, but misunderstandings gradually arose between them, fostered by wounded pride on her side and on his by the Archduchess Sophie’s constant efforts to lower her in the eyes of her son. Dearly as she loved Franz Joseph, Elizabeth held herself more and more aloof from him for fear of seeming the troublesome child her mother-in-law called her, and an expression of quiet sadness grew upon her. But there were moments, too, of hot revolt against the cold, selfish world in which she lived, and these did not mend matters for her. Rash and thoughtless, she struggled against this unceasing persecution. She treated the Archduchess’ followers with marked disdain and gave her confidence to others who deceived and betrayed her. 46 Chapter VI Travels and Sorrows Nothing had been originally farther from the wishes of the young Empress than to fill her throne in solitary state, surrounded only by a few chosen families of noble birth. What she most wanted was to go about among the people and get acquainted with her new subjects, and during the early part of her married life she was often seen in the streets of Vienna. Wherever she went crowds gathered, struggling and pushing good-naturedly to get as near a view of her as possible. One day she went out to walk, accompanied only by one of her ladies-in-waiting and without informing any one of her intention. On one of the principal squares, seeing something in a window that attracted her, she entered the shop, but on turning to go out again was unpleasantly surprised to find hundreds of faces peering in at the door and windows, and it was only with the aid of the police that she was able to reach the street again. This incident excited the greatest disapproval at court. 47 “Her Majesty seems to imagine herself still in the mountains of Bavaria. She forgets that she is the Empress of Austria and what she owes to her husband’s position,” was whispered about her. Discouraged at the result of her attempts to mingle with the people, she thenceforth avoided appearing in public as much as possible, confining her walks to the secluded portions of the palace gardens or the park about Schönbrunn. But even this did not satisfy the court, which now found fault with her for neglecting to show herself before the people on every possible occasion. This hostility and opposition that met the young Empress at every turn only made her retire the more within herself, and really inflicted an irreparable wrong, for it developed in her an inherited love of solitude that, once acquired, soon became too fixed ever to be renounced. Meanwhile the outlying portions of the Empire—Bohemia, Moravia, Galicia, and Hungary—were waiting anxiously to welcome the imperial pair, and soon after the wedding they began a series of short journeys. 48 In September, 1856, they made a visit to the Austrian Alps that is still remembered and talked of even in the remotest mountain valleys. From Heiligenblut, where they spent the night, the Emperor and Empress climbed the Grossglockner. About four o’ clock in the morning, after hearing mass in the little parish church, they began the ascent, accompanied by two experienced guides, Elizabeth riding part of the way, while her husband walked. During the walk he gathered a bunch of edelweiss growing on a steep cliff and handed it to his wife, saying, “This is the first edelweiss I ever picked.” At the Wallner Hut, as it was then called, the Empress stopped to rest, while Franz Joseph climbed to the lofty Glockner-saddle, and it was in remembrance of this visit that the Wallner Hut received the name of Elisabeth-ruhe. From there they went to Steiermark and thence to Gratz, where they arrived on the eleventh of September, and where, as at all other places, they were received with the greatest enthusiasm. In November of the same year they visited the Italian provinces which at that time formed part of their dominions. Owing to the political disturbances of the period and the feeling of the Italians against Austria, it was feared the sovereigns would meet with a cold reception; but the “mistress of the Adriatic” had decked herself magnificently to greet the young Empress. The streets and market-places were brilliantly illuminated and gorgeous masked balls were given in her honor. All hearts were won by Elizabeth’s beauty and charm of manner, and the delighted Emperor said to her: 49 “Your smile has done more toward conquering the people than all my armies have been able to accomplish!” Franz Joseph, as we have seen, was a mere youth when his uncle, the Emperor Ferdinand, abdicated in his favor and retired to Prague to end his days. The young sovereign had scarcely ascended the throne when rebellion broke out in Hungary, and unable to quell the disturbance alone he was forced to seek aid from Russia. Czar Nicholas placed one hundred thousand men at his disposal, and the revolt of 1848-1849 was crushed with a firm hand. Countless towns, villages, and estates were laid in ashes, and the country was left bleeding from almost incurable wounds. The people bore their hard fate in sullen defiance, and five years later, when the Emperor married, time had done little to soften their hatred of Austria. 50 The pardon that Franz Joseph had granted on his wedding day to all political offenders in his dominions formed one step toward reconciliation, but the first real signs of a more friendly feeling were due not to him but to the Queen. It was her smile that finally appeased the wrath of the Hungarians, her beauty and goodness that laid the foundation of more amicable relations between them and their sovereign. She devoted herself assiduously to the study of their language, one of the most difficult in Europe, interested herself in the art and customs of the country, and showed such deep concern for their welfare that she is said to have wept on occasions when her husband refused to grant their wishes. The reason for Elizabeth’s sudden and strong attachment to this hitherto unknown country could have been only a psychological one. When she first came to Vienna, she was impressed with the violent prejudice that existed at court against the Hungarians. Each attempt of that liberty-loving people to throw off their chains was regarded as a fresh crime by the Archduchess Sophie and her adherents, and the Empress heard much harsh criticism of her subjects beyond the Leytha. Her natural perversity and independence, however, led her to investigate the matter for herself, and she soon gained a very different idea of the open-hearted, chivalrous Hungarians, whose natural character was so like her own. Hoping to learn more of the inner life of the people by means of the language, she began the study of it with a zeal and industry that shrank from no difficulties till in time she acquired perfect mastery of it even to speaking it like a native. 51 “Queen Elizabeth speaks our language without a trace of foreign accent,” said the Hungarian poet, Maurus Jókai, “speaks it like a peasant woman and without any of the affectation common with most of our court ladies.” Her first teacher was an old professor named Homokh, with whom she learned the grammar and to read easily. But this did not satisfy her. She wanted a thorough knowledge of Hungarian literature and engaged as her instructor Dr. Max Falk, at that time a journalist in Vienna. His methods were far less tedious than those of Homokh, and she began to read the best passages of Scripture, together with a history of the people. He also gave her for translation into Hungarian the French correspondence between Joseph Second of Austria and Catherine Second of Russia, published by Arnath, a task she found most delightful. Her tutor was charmed with her enthusiasm and the accuracy with which she performed her duties as pupil. One morning as she handed him her written translation, she said: “All day yesterday my time was taken up with audiences, and in the evening there was a court concert. After that I was so tired I went directly to bed, but no sooner had I lain down than I remembered my Hungarian translation had not been written. So I tore a leaf from the almanac that lay on a table beside my bed and did it there. Excuse the pencil.” 52 It was not until May, 1857, however, that she made her first visit to Hungary. Her arrival was hailed with enthusiasm, and the young Queen was everywhere greeted with shouts of joy. An extensive tour of the country had been planned by the sovereigns, but a sad event forced them to abandon it. The Emperor and Empress had two children at this time, the little Archduchesses Sophie and Gisela. Scarcely had the court established itself in the royal palace at Ofen when word was received of the illness of the two-year-old Sophie. The physicians’ first reports were reassuring, but on reaching Debreczin, May 28, the despatches announced a change for the worse. The anxious parents hastened back to Budapest, where on the next evening they heard that their oldest child was dead. Elizabeth left Hungary with tears in her eyes. Her first great sorrow had befallen her on her first visit among the Magyars, and it may have been that grief attached her still more closely to this people whom in after years she loved so well and by whom she was adored as a sovereign and reverenced as a guardian angel. 53 Chapter VII Birth of Crown Prince Rudolf Not only the Emperor and his family but the whole nation were anxious for an heir to the throne, and the disappointment was great when on May 5, 1855, the Empress gave birth to a daughter, who was called Sophie Dorothea, after the Emperor’s mother. Elizabeth was too young and inexperienced to understand this, though she could not fail to read the evidences of it in the faces of those about her. Still greater dissatisfaction greeted the birth of a second daughter, Gisela, in July, 1856. This daughter was married in 1873 to Prince Leopold of Bavaria, second son of the present Prince Regent. 54 The Empress looked forward to her maternal duties with the greatest happiness, and asked nothing more than to devote herself to her children. But even this was not to be allowed her. The Archduchess Sophie had the little girls removed almost immediately to a remote wing of the Hofburg, leaving the young mother alone in her splendid apartments, where she had always felt herself so much a stranger. Involuntarily she compared her lot with that of her mother, the mistress of Possenhoffen, whose busy life was filled with work and noble sacrifices for her flock of children, while the Empress of Austria had nothing left her but to preserve her beauty and exhibit her toilettes. The importance of providing the Empire with an heir was impressed upon her so constantly that she was puzzled and asked her own mother once in a moment of confidence: “If I should have no son, do you suppose that Franz would follow Napoleon’s example and cause our marriage to be annulled?” “Do not think of such things, my child,” replied the Duchess. “You know that Franz loves you devotedly.” Then she continued: “There are two sorts of women in this world,—those who always get their own way and those who never get it. You seem to me to be one of the latter. You have great abilities and do not lack character. But you have not the faculty of stooping to the level of your associates, or adapting yourself to your environment. You belong to another period, that in which saints and martyrs existed. Do not attract notice by being too obviously the first or break your own heart by fancying yourself the latter.” 55 At last, shortly before her twenty-first birthday, her dearest wishes were gratified, and on August 21, 1858, a son was born to the imperial pair, a beautiful child though somewhat delicate, in whose cradle the delighted father hastened to lay the Order of the Golden Fleece. The next morning the good news was carried by telegraph to every corner of the world, a salute of a hundred and one guns was fired from all the fortresses in Austria and Hungary, and the signal was echoed from a million throats, while public enthusiasm was still further increased when the Crown Prince, at his christening, received the name of his great ancestor Rudolf of Hapsburg. The popularity of the Empress was at once restored. Her enemies were silenced, her mother-in-law contented, and she herself for a time was happy. “No one has seemed to need me until now,” she declared pathetically, “not even my little girl whom they keep from me as much as possible. But I will not permit my boy to be taken away and given to the care of strangers. He will need me and we will be happy in each other.” 56 Again, however, she was mistaken. Rudolf was installed as soon as possible in a remote part of the palace, the Archduchess insisting that it was not suitable for the heir to a great empire to be brought up by a young mother who as yet did not even know how to conduct herself. When Elizabeth begged to be allowed the care of her own child and dwelt on the comfort it would be to her, her mother-in-law declared indignantly that it was absurd to talk of the need for comfort when she had everything in the world to make her happy. From Sophie’s point of view indeed this was perhaps true, but Elizabeth was of a different stamp, and no outward luxury could make up to her for disappointed hopes or an empty heart. Matters grew still worse for her when in the Summer of 1857 the Emperor’s second brother, Ferdinand Maximilian, married Charlotte, the daughter of King Leopold First of Belgium. This aspiring princess attached herself at once to the court party and became a great favorite with her mother-in-law. Meanwhile heavy clouds were gathering on the political horizon. Among Franz Joseph’s Italian subjects the ferment was strongest, but throughout the whole Empire there was great discontent. It was well known that the Archduchess Sophie held the reins of power, and that it was she who declared war or concluded peace,—a state of things that caused much opposition in diplomatic circles, while all classes united in condemning this so-called “petticoat government.” 57 When the war with France and Sardinia broke out in 1859, it was less a question of the country’s incontestable rights than of the maintenance of the power of the Jesuits. Elizabeth plainly saw the mistake her husband was making in allowing himself to be guided so much by his mother in political matters and longed to use her influence with him to prevent it, but she was powerless. No one asked her advice, no one cared for her opinion; so she held her peace. While Franz Joseph was fighting at Solferino and his mother corresponded with foreign courts or held long conferences with statesmen and diplomats, the Empress had to content herself with visiting wounded soldiers and officers from the Italian battlefields. Like an angel of mercy she went about among the hospitals, tasting the food that had been prepared and distributing money and cigars. Her gentle words of pity and cheer carried the more weight since they had none of the sanctimonious tone so common at that time. The halo of piety with which the Archduchess Sophie enveloped all her actions was most distasteful to Elizabeth, who did not attempt to conceal her dislike of the clergy. Once at a court ball, her train became entangled around the feet of the papal nuncio, who happened to be standing near. With an angry glance the Empress jerked it toward her with such force that the prelate barely escaped a fall,—a scene that was the cause of much suppressed merriment, for it was well known that Her Majesty would quite as gladly have deprived him of his influence at court as upset his person in the ball-room. 58 Chapter VIII Elizabeth’s Illness and Sojourn in Madeira The estrangement between the Emperor and Empress gradually increased. Affairs of state, the distractions of court life, together with Franz Joseph’s growing disposition to return to the habits and pleasures of his bachelor life, all tended to widen the breach between them. The Emperor was naturally kind and affectionate, but he also had weaknesses which on closer acquaintance proved him to be far from the ideal character his young wife had imagined. She was too proud to stoop to unworthy means to retain his attachment for her, and her increasing sadness and reserve as well as her disinclination to take part in the festivities of the court, only wearied and helped to estrange him the more, as he felt in it a silent reproach. 59 Elizabeth had expected to find complete happiness in his love, and her solitary position at court in an atmosphere so hostile had made her cling yet more closely to this hope. By this time, however, reality had dispelled this illusion. She did not feel that she had lost her power over him or even his love, but her faith in him was shaken and her confidence destroyed. To be pitied was unendurable to the proud daughter of the Wittelsbachs. She hid her disappointment from the world and retired more and more within herself. At length her health began to give way. She struggled bravely against her growing weakness, but was finally seized with an illness which her physicians could neither understand nor cure. After repeated consultations it was decided that her lungs were affected, and a journey to Madeira was advised, that place being at the time regarded as the most favorable one for troubles of that kind. For a long time she refused to follow their advice, but finally early in the year 1861 she consented to go. Those who saw her start doubted whether she would ever return, and she herself had little hope of regaining her health. 60 She left Europe wrapped in mist and cold. When she landed in Madeira, a week later, she was greeted by blue skies, brilliant sunshine, and tropical vegetation. The villa she was to occupy was charmingly situated, with wide verandas, terraces overlooking the sea, and a chain of mountains stretching behind it. Under these new conditions the Empress began at once to improve and by the first of March was able to make daily excursions about the island, which was now ablaze with flowers. She even grew to look upon her illness as a deliverer. It had enabled her to escape from the oppression of court life, and the quiet solitude taught her patience and gave her strength to bear the trials still in store for her. She lived over the struggles of her life at Vienna, so different from the happy days of childhood in her peaceful Bavarian home, the memory of which, together with the tales and legends she had heard at her father’s knee, returned so often and so vividly to her mind. She rose early every morning, studied, and practised her music, wrote daily letters to her husband and her parents, and took long walks upon the shore. Once during her stay on the island she had a visit from her sister Helene, who had married the Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Vessels rarely stopped there, and her life was most uneventful; but nature, which she had always loved, now became doubly dear. It was there too that she discovered a new interest in the world of poetry, and books soon became like friends to her. In the long solitary evenings she would take refuge in them from the restless longings of her heart and forget for the time her cares and troubles. Meanwhile, in Vienna, news of the Empress’ death was daily expected, but instead came word that her cough grew better, and at last it was announced that the climate of Madeira had done its work and she would be allowed to come back after a stay of four months. 61 On the way home in the middle of May a frightful storm arose, and the yacht Victoria and Albert (which had been loaned her by Queen Victoria of England for the return voyage) was tossed about like a nutshell on the angry sea. The Empress, however, refused to leave the deck in spite of all entreaties and the mountainous waves that threatened to sweep her over the side of the vessel. She even had herself fastened to the mast that she might safely enjoy the wonderful spectacle. On the eighteenth of May she was met off Trieste by the Emperor, who had come out on a warship to welcome her with an escort of five steamboats carrying notables and citizens with bands of music. At ten o’clock a shot from the castle announced the approach of the flotilla, and amid thundering salutes from batteries and warships the Emperor and Empress entered the harbor and landed near Miramar, the pleasure palace built for Archduke Maximilian, afterward Emperor of Mexico. A celebrated painting depicts the meeting between the young Archduchess Charlotte and Elizabeth on the great marble terrace overlooking the sea. 62 At Baden Elizabeth saw her mother-in-law and children again, and five days later the imperial pair entered Vienna, the railway station of which was decorated with flowers in honor of the occasion. They drove to the palace in an open carriage amid the cheers of the populace, whose joy over the Empress’ recovery found further expression the following day in praise services held in all the churches of the city. 63 Chapter IX The Empress’ Flight from Vienna Elizabeth’s sojourn in Madeira did not bring the permanent improvement that was hoped for. A few weeks after her return to Austria the cough returned, and fearing that the nature of her illness had been mistaken, her parents’ physician who had had the care of her in her youth was sent for. He decided that she was suffering from acute indigestion and that a change was imperative. This time the place of resort chosen was the island of Corfu, where she arrived safely soon afterward, accompanied by her physician. The Empress was charmed with the villa that had been secured for her, about half an hour’s drive from the capital. It was surrounded with gardens and large grounds, and in a shorter time even than at Madeira she began to show the beneficial effects of the climate. 64 Not far from the house was the mountain Aja Kyriahi, on the summit of which stood a small church surrounded with cypresses. Every morning before sunrise she climbed to this spot, and whenever in after years she came back to Corfu she always visited it. At the end of two months her health was quite restored, and toward the close of October she left for Venice, where she held her court that Winter. Her return to Vienna the following August, after a sojourn in the Tyrol, was the occasion for almost as much enthusiasm as on her wedding day, the people everywhere showing the most touching proofs of their sympathy and devotion. But again her stay in Vienna was destined to be of short duration, for after the lapse of a few weeks, unexpectedly and without confiding her intentions to any one, she left the capital, to seek refuge in travel from the troubles and complications of her position there. The Emperor followed to try and bring about a reconciliation, but she refused to meet him, and he returned at length to Vienna weary and disheartened. With her capacity for loving and her pride Elizabeth must have suffered intensely from the slights and disappointments of her married life, and fresh persecutions on the part of her mother-in-law, who had already succeeded in estranging her husband and children from her, no doubt led her to this step. 65 Months went by, and still the Empress continued her wanderings. There was a general feeling of sympathy for the Emperor, but in spite of this many began to take the part of his young wife, and when the Archduchess Sophie condemned her too harshly, believed that had it not been for “Madame Mère,” her daughter-in-law would never have gone away. The estrangement lasted for several years, but Elizabeth, at the urgent entreaties not only of the court but of her own family, agreed to return to Vienna once or twice a year to fulfil the state duties required of her. She remained no longer than necessary, however. The joys of travel had become too dear to her, the constraints of court life too irksome. 66 Franz Joseph meanwhile was growing more and more unreconciled to this state of affairs. The health of the Crown Prince was causing some anxiety, and his Majesty was urged to make his peace with the Empress. Elizabeth accordingly was approached by her mother, the Duchess Ludovica, for whose opinion she had the greatest respect, and who finally convinced her that it was her duty to go back to her children. Time and loneliness too had softened the bitterness of her feelings and awakened a mutual desire for reconciliation. Outside events also helped to bring about the reunion. Misfortune had overtaken Austria: the war of 1866 had driven the Hapsburgs from Italy and Germany, and Elizabeth, roused to sympathy, turned her face homeward, feeling that her place was with the Emperor and his people. Though still young in years her sorrows and trials had robbed her of her youth, and she came back a woman strong and self-reliant, caring little for court life, but devoting herself to hospital work among the wounded soldiers with an energy and self-sacrifice that earned her the reverence of all. Day after day she spent at the bedsides of the suffering, speaking to each in his own language and seeking to satisfy his wants. One man, named Joseph Feher, had refused to have his arm amputated, but the Empress begged him so earnestly to consent to the operation that he finally yielded, and she wrote to his mother that she would have her son taken to the palace of Laxenburg and provide for his future. Another day she came upon a soldier whose head had been so nearly severed that the physicians had no hope of saving him. Sitting down beside him, she asked if he had any last requests that she might fulfil for him. In a faltering voice he answered: “Since I have had the happiness of seeing the Empress at my death-bed, there is nothing left to wish for in this world. I die happy!” Wherever she appeared the weakest tried to lift themselves at her approach. Arms were outstretched to touch her as she passed, and when she left, there was a general murmur of— “God bless our Elizabeth!” 67 Chapter X The Coronation in Hungary Again the Archduchess Sophie’s schemes for the house of Hapsburg proved disastrous, and Franz Joseph’s eyes were opened at last to the fact that her sway had been as unfortunate for the country as it was fatal to his domestic happiness. In these bitter days of defeat and humiliation he learned to value the Empress at her true worth. She now became his real companion. In the latter years of her life he often consulted her in regard to affairs of state, and she might have exercised a much greater power in politics had she so desired. But the only matter of government in which she ever cared to have a voice was in regard to Hungary, in whose welfare she always felt the deepest interest. After the Austrian losses in 1866 she once said to Count Julius Andrassy: “It distresses me to have things go wrong in Italy, but if anything were to happen to Hungary it would kill me!” 68 One Summer while visiting some baths, she climbed a near-by mountain on the summit of which a small chalet had been built. As they entered, her companion, seeing a visitor’s book on the table, wrote in it “Elizabeth, Empress of Austria.” Thereupon her mistress drew off her gloves and, taking the pen, added in Hungarian, “Elizabeth, Queen of Hungary.” This mutual attachment proved a valuable safeguard during the war of 1866, when the Prussians threatened to advance on Vienna. It was thought safest for Elizabeth and the little Crown Prince to retire to Budapest, where she was received with an enthusiasm little short of Maria Theresa’s memorable reception. There is no doubt that the devotion of the people to the Queen was largely instrumental in bringing about a better feeling between Austria and Hungary, while still another proof of this devotion was their special request that she might be crowned together with the King, an event that had never before occurred in the history of the country. 69 It was not until the eighth of June, 1867, however, that the coronation took place. The ancient city of Pressburg had been the scene of all former coronations, but on this occasion the ceremonies were to be held for the first time in Ofen and Pesth, or Budapest, as it is now called, which had been made the capital in 1848. The city is one of the most beautifully situated in all Europe. On an almost perpendicular rock stands the royal castle, an imposing structure of great antiquity, and at its foot, surrounding it on three sides, lies Ofen. The flat and more modern town of Pesth is to the left, and beyond it extend boundless plains. Both cities were in gala attire to welcome the sovereigns. In every direction as far as the eye could reach was a sea of waving flags and pennants, and on the spire of the Rathshaus gleamed a huge crown of St. Stephen. The evening before the ceremony was to take place Franz Joseph and his wife made a visit to the cathedral, which had been magnificently decorated for the occasion, and were greeted everywhere with the wildest enthusiasm. As they were about to leave the church an old man fell from a ladder on which he had perched himself in order to obtain a view of “the good Queen of Hungary.” Elizabeth, who saw him fall, hastened at once to his assistance,—an act that called forth renewed cheers when it reached the ears of those outside. 70 The town was crowded with Magyars from all parts of the kingdom, and sixty thousand troops lined the streets from the railway station to the royal castle, a distance of six kilometres. It was a most brilliant sight as the procession wound slowly down from the castle and crossed the bridge. Franz Joseph made a stately and imposing figure in his crown and coronation robes, but Elizabeth was the centre of all eyes. The sides of the coach were of glass so that she could be seen from all directions. It was surmounted by a large crown and drawn by six magnificent white horses, their long manes and tails interwoven with gold. Elizabeth at this time was in the prime of her majestic loveliness, having not yet reached her thirtieth year, and was considered the most beautiful princess in the whole civilized world. Deafening “Eljens” greeted her all the way to the cathedral, cannon thundered, and white-clad maidens showered roses in her path. 71 Immediately behind the Queen followed a mounted escort of two hundred young nobles in the gorgeous costume of the Hungarian magnate, covered with gold and precious stones. Their reins and stirrups were similarly adorned, and over the left shoulder they wore a leopard skin. The King and his suite had already taken their places in the cathedral when the Queen entered. She wore a dress of white brocaded satin and a black velvet bodice covered with diamonds. The coronation robe was also of black velvet, bordered with white satin. About her neck was a Hungarian necklace of diamonds, and on her head she wore the Hapsburg coronet that had been made originally for Maria Theresa. It is composed entirely of pearls and diamonds and is valued at three million gulden. While the King was being crowned, she remained seated with clasped hands absorbed in prayer, after which she in turn went through her part of the ceremony. As she resumed her place upon the throne beside the Emperor with orb and sceptre in hand, the whole assemblage joined in a mighty Te Deum which re-echoed from the vaulted roof of the old church. The coronation ceremonies and the enthusiasm with which she was everywhere received made such an impression upon Elizabeth that she could never afterward speak of them without emotion and always regarded the occasion as one of the happiest times of her life. 72 Chapter XI The Archduchess Marie Valerie The years following the coronation in Hungary were without doubt among the happiest of the Empress Elizabeth’s life. She interested herself in the details of her children’s education, shared her husband’s occupations and anxieties, and resumed her place at court with a dignity and loftiness of purpose that completely silenced her enemies. Conditions too had changed. The Archduchess Sophie had not only ceased to be a ruling power, but was completely crushed by the death of her second son, Maximilian, in Mexico, where he had been condemned to death and shot in 1867, after he had reluctantly accepted the throne. His unhappy wife, whose ambition was partly responsible for these tragic events, became hopelessly insane and it fell to Elizabeth’s lot to support and comfort the grief-stricken family. 73 The following year, April 22, 1868, another daughter was born to the imperial pair at the royal castle at Ofen. It was the first time for a century that a child of the royal house had been born in Hungary, and the enthusiasm of the Magyars knew no bounds. All night the streets were filled with excited throngs shouting “Eljens” for the King and Queen and the new-born Princess. The Archduchess Marie Valerie, as she was christened, became the Empress’ favorite child. The two older ones had been kept away from her so long that at first they were completely estranged and it required much patience and devotion on her part to gain their affection and confidence. The Crown Prince, who was ten years old at that time, was a most interesting child and already a universal favorite, but under his grandmother’s influence he had developed a mixture of wayward pride and vanity that troubled his mother greatly and which she strove hard to correct. Fortunately, however, Rudolf was tender-hearted and easily influenced, and she succeeded at last to a large extent in overcoming the evil effects of the adulation and flattery with which the little heir had been surrounded. With Valerie she determined it should be different, and from earliest babyhood her training and education became the Empress’ chief care. She was a delicate child, and the mother watched over her with a devotion that seemed almost like a reparation for what she had failed to give her other children. She was present at the lessons of the two elder ones whenever possible and took the greatest interest in their education, repeatedly impressing on their teachers that she did not want them favored or spoiled. She taught the little girls to dance, and the first dance that Valerie learned was the Hungarian Czardas. She tried to implant in them her own love for Hungary and urged their tutors and governesses “to make them as little German as possible.” 74 Christmas was the most joyful time in the year for the imperial family, and Christmas Eve, being also Elizabeth’s birthday, was celebrated as a double feast. There were always two trees, the smaller of which the Empress decorated with her own hands for the children. She spent days looking for appropriate gifts for them and the Emperor, as well as the various members of the court, whose individual tastes she always tried to gratify. One day, shortly before Christmas, Marie Valerie came to her mother with a beseeching air and begged that the presents intended for her might be given to some poor children. Much touched by the idea, Elizabeth consented, and from that time there was always another tree laden with gifts for the unfortunates. 75 The Empress adored flowers. During her rambles she would gather whole armfuls, and even when riding would often spring from her horse to pick wild flowers and fasten them to the pommel of her saddle. Her rooms were always filled with them, and if any choice blossom chanced to please her especially she would carry it at night into her own bedroom. “Mutzerl,” as Marie Valerie was called, inherited this passion of her mother’s, and almost as soon as she could walk she started little gardens of her own at the different places where the court stayed in turn. She was her mother’s constant companion and there was the most touching sympathy and devotion between them. “Valerie is not only a daughter to me,” Elizabeth once said, “but my best friend and companion.” 76 The Archduchess was remarkable for her simplicity and lack of self-consciousness, as well as for her dignity and kindness of heart. Elizabeth was a firm believer in the virtues of physical exercise and had her daughter taught to ride, fence, and shoot; but Valerie did not altogether share her love of long walks and rides. She had the Wittelsbach love of art and literature, was devoted to poetry and even as a child wrote verses of some merit. Remembering the mortifications her own lack of education had caused her in her early married life, the Empress took special interest in Valerie’s education. She had her taught Latin and Greek, besides several modern languages, and shared her studies as much as possible, often poring over some difficult passage in Greek Scripture with her or learning by heart the most beautiful verses. The young poetess looked upon her mother as her most valuable critic and showed her all her poems which filled several volumes, deferring always to the Empress’ judgment and finding in her praise her greatest reward. She was devoted to both her parents, but as time went on became almost a second self to her mother—the living token of the reconciliation between herself and the Emperor, and a consolation for all her loneliness and suffering. 77 Chapter XII The Castle of Gödöllö Not long after their wedding the Emperor and Empress visited an exhibition of paintings in Vienna. Franz Joseph was anxious to purchase some of them, but left the choice entirely to his wife, who went back accordingly a few days later with one of her ladies and selected twenty-four, every one of which when sent to the palace proved to be of horses. Both at the Hofburg and at Schönbrunn her chief interest was in the imperial stables, where she spent most of her mornings trying different mounts. She loved exercise of all kinds, but riding was her greatest delight and her skill and daring as a horsewoman were remarkable. Authorities in these matters have declared that she outshone any rider of her own sex, for she had a singular, almost hypnotic power over horses, and even the most vicious ones would allow her to approach and stroke them. Her slender wrists were like steel, and there was no horse she could not ride when once she had made up her mind to do so. Fear and fatigue were alike unknown to her, and she used often to terrify the director of the riding-school in Vienna by asking him to send her one or two of his wildest specimens to try. A cavalry officer once expressed his surprise to the Emperor at his allowing the Empress of Austria to spend so much time in the stables and make companions of jockeys and circus riders. “Ah, my young friend,” replied the Emperor kindly, “it is evident you do not know women. They usually do as they please without waiting for our permission.” 78 Elizabeth never appeared to better advantage than when on horseback. Her habit, which seemed as if moulded to her figure, was usually dark blue, trimmed with fur. She also wore a low round hat and heavy riding-gloves, but never a flower or bow or anything superfluous except a black fan, which she carried in her hand or hung by a strap to her saddle. Strangers generally supposed this was to protect her complexion, but her friends were well aware that it was merely to guard herself from the inevitable photographers who pursued her everywhere. “I hate being photographed,” she once declared: “every time in my life that I have been, something dreadful has happened to me.” She liked to attend to her horses personally and visited them every morning, taking sugar and carrots in her pocket for them, sometimes even going into their stalls to pet or rub them down. At Schönbrunn she had a room the walls of which were completely covered with pictures of horses. “Look,” she once said to her Greek teacher when showing him this room, “all these are friends I have lost. Many of them have died for me, which is more than I can say of any human being. People would far rather have me killed.” She was never so happy as when in the saddle, dashing through the forests of Austria or the wide Hungarian plains. But these long rides also served another purpose. On both sides of the house she had relatives whose lives were darkened by the fatal inheritance of the Wittelsbachs; so it was not strange that as she grew older her sensitive nature should have brooded over the fear of developing the family disorder. To banish these terrible fits of depression she would gallop for hours, insensible to weather or physical exhaustion, sometimes drenched to the skin, and it was only when she felt her horse quiver under her with fatigue that she would slacken her pace. 79 Immediately after the coronation the Hungarians presented to their Queen the castle of Gödöllö, situated in the depths of the forest, not far from Budapest, and for many years it was her favorite residence. Here there was nothing to break the peaceful seclusion but the plaintive notes of the Zingaris’ violins. Here she was her own mistress, spending long, happy, care-free days. She usually rose at four o’clock, and was in the saddle from five till eleven, when she breakfasted. It was an ideal country for riding, and she became familiar with every forest pathway for miles around, often stopping at some camp of the Czikos to chat with these half-savage Bedouins of the Hungarian Puszta, in whom she felt the greatest interest. She brought them gifts of tobacco, and was always welcomed with delight by these strange herdsmen. 80 But there were gay times also at Gödöllö in those days, when her husband and children were there and the castle was full of guests. Her stag hunts were famous, and the walls were covered with trophies of the chase. “There is a tree at Gödöllö,” she once said to a companion, “who is one of my best friends. He knows all my inmost thoughts, and whenever I go back there I tell him all that has happened to me since we parted.” 81 Wherever she might be her thoughts turned longingly toward her beloved Hungary, where she was happiest, and among whose romantic, impulsive people she always felt most at home. All classes in Budapest adored their beautiful Queen, who wore the national costume of the country and lost no opportunity of remaining among them. Her courage, gentleness, and open-hearted generosity made her universally beloved. She would go about among the poorest and vilest quarters of the city, helping the suffering and needy, quite unconscious of danger or fear. The wretched creatures often little suspected who she was, but she was welcomed everywhere as an angel of mercy, and could go unharmed where even the police would scarcely venture. 82 One evening she was riding with a companion through the outskirts of Budapest, and was just passing a hovel set back a little from the main road when they were startled by hearing piercing shrieks from within. The voice was that of a woman evidently in the greatest distress. On the impulse of the moment they leaped from their horses, and rushing to the door and bursting it open, found themselves in a low, dirty room, where a huge ruffian of a man was dragging a woman about the floor by her long, unbound hair, kicking her vigorously as he did so. Without a moment’s thought Elizabeth dealt him a blow in the face with her heavy hunting-crop, which so surprised the fellow that he dropped his victim and stared at her in blank amazement. Elizabeth’s own astonishment was still greater, however, when the ill-used woman arose and sprang at her like a tiger, overwhelming her at the same time with the vilest abuse for presuming to attack her husband. The Empress burst into a peal of laughter, and taking a gold piece from her pocket she handed it to the man, exclaiming: “Beat her, my friend. Beat her all she wants; she deserves it for being so loyal to you.” 83 Chapter XIII The Empress in Vienna The year 1873 was a memorable one to Franz Joseph and Elizabeth. Their eldest daughter, Gisela, was married, April 20, to Prince Leopold of Bavaria in the Church of the Augustins, where the imperial pair had celebrated their union nineteen years before. The bride was led to the altar by her mother and left that same afternoon with her husband for Munich. The Viennese overwhelmed the Archduchess with gifts and entertainments, and the streets were lined with crowds eager to witness the departure of the young couple. 84 A few days afterward, May 1, 1873, the Emperor and Empress opened the World’s Exposition at Vienna, an event that was celebrated with all sorts of festivities and made the occasion of a perfect jubilee. The Exhibition was a great success as well as a source of pride to Austria, as it demonstrated what the country could accomplish in the way of arts and manufactures in a comparatively short space of time. Many of the crowned heads of Europe came as guests to the capital. The old Emperor William and his clever wife Augusta visited at the Hofburg and Schönbrunn; Czar Alexander Second of Russia and King Victor Emmanuel of Italy also came, as did the Shah of Persia and many others. Elizabeth, however, cared little for people of her own rank. “Titles mean nothing,” she declared; “they are only the trappings with which we try to hide our nakedness; they do not change our real selves.” Little to her taste as court ceremonies were, she bore her part in them with ease and dignity and was always the centre of interest and admiration wherever she went. Some years before the fall of the French Empire, the Austrian sovereigns met Napoleon and Eugénie at Salzburg. The French Empress was then at the zenith of her beauty, but Elizabeth with her glorious eyes and hair and the wonderful charm of her personality did not suffer by comparison with the Spaniard nor even with younger princesses. 85 In 1873 the twenty-fifth anniversary of Franz Joseph’s accession to the throne was celebrated with great rejoicings, the festivities culminating in the evening by the triumphal progress of the imperial pair with the Crown Prince through the streets of Vienna, which were brilliantly illuminated and decorated and filled with cheering throngs. But even on this occasion it was evident Elizabeth found it an effort to appear in public, and she avoided the noise and confusion as much as possible. Her growing reserve and dislike of self-display were taken as a personal offence by the spectacle-loving Viennese and added to her unpopularity. She was considered cold and proud and was taxed with heartlessness and indifference, a fact of which she was well aware and which only added to her melancholy. She adored children, rich and poor alike, and at the close of the Vienna Exposition took into her service a little Berber boy named Mahmoud, who had acted as page in the Cairene house erected in the Prater by the Khedive of Egypt and afterward presented to the Empress. Mahmoud adored his mistress and she was exceedingly kind to him. When the climate of Vienna affected his lungs and he fell ill with pneumonia, she nursed and tended him herself, and he became the favorite playmate of the Archduchess Valerie, greatly to the horror of the Austrian aristocracy. Patience was not one of the Wittelsbach virtues, and so many false and cruel reports were circulated about her in Vienna by careless tongues that when Elizabeth was informed of the indignation she had aroused by her kindness to Mahmoud she responded by having the two children photographed together and the picture displayed in public. This act of defiance naturally added to the number of her detractors, and many even began to hint that the Empress’ restlessness and eccentricities were certain signs of approaching insanity. 86 But there was still another reason for the Empress’ unpopularity in the Austrian capital. Her husband’s German subjects keenly felt her lack of sympathy with them and resented her unconcealed preference for Hungary. It was even rumored that she intended to bestow all her Austrian possessions upon the Magyars, but this was a rank injustice to Elizabeth, for throughout the Empire, Austria as well as Hungary, there was scarcely a charitable institution or cause that she did not aid or support, nor a case of suffering and need that she did not attempt to relieve. When Austria took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, the Empress found a fresh field for her energies in caring for the wounded soldiers and providing for the families of those who were killed; and when cholera and smallpox broke out in Budapest, she insisted upon accompanying the Emperor, who was obliged to go there for the opening of the National Assembly, declaring that in time of danger her place was at her husband’s side. 87 In 1879 Franz Joseph and Elizabeth celebrated their silver wedding, an occasion not unmixed with sadness to them both, as they looked back on the trials and disappointments of their married life. They had requested that there should be no public observance of the day, and that the sums contributed for that purpose should be given to charity. An exception to this was made, however, in Vienna, where a great ovation had been prepared for the imperial pair. On the spot where the Emperor had been attacked by Libeny, the Hungarian, a church had been erected to commemorate his fortunate escape, and this was to be formally dedicated as part of the ceremonies of the day. The city was en fête, and crowds had gathered to salute the Emperor and Empress as they drove to and from the church. There was little in their appearance to suggest the storms that had shaken their lives, for Franz Joseph was still in the prime of his manhood and Elizabeth the youngest and most beautiful of grandmothers (her eldest daughter Gisela had several children at that time). The festivities, which lasted several days, concluded on the twenty-seventh of April with an historical pageant, arranged by the celebrated painter Hans Makart and carried out on the most magnificent scale. Every class, institution, and province in the kingdom was represented, and the various groups costumed with historical accuracy, the whole procession making a most imposing spectacle as it moved slowly along the Ringstrasse amid the deafening cheers of the spectators. 88 Chapter XIV Marriage of Crown Prince Rudolf Both Franz Joseph and Elizabeth were very proud of their only son, whose winning ways and kindness of heart had made him wonderfully popular with all classes. He had inherited his mother’s impatience of restraint as well as her literary and artistic tastes, and, like her, cared little for people of his own rank. His own intimate circle was composed of poets, artists, and journalists, and he had an enthusiastic friend and teacher in the celebrated naturalist, Brehm. According to the custom of Austrian princes, he had been required to learn some trade and chose that of printing, but he possessed a marked talent for writing and published several books of real merit. He adored his mother, and the relation between them was one of the closest confidence and intimacy, but Elizabeth’s love for her son did not blind her to his faults, and she fully realized that he had all his father’s youthful susceptibility and love of pleasure. Both she and the Emperor were agreed as to the necessity of his marrying early, not only to insure the succession, but also because they hoped it would steady the rather wild and headstrong young prince. Franz Joseph, however, had political advantages most in mind in the choice of a wife for his son, while Elizabeth was chiefly concerned as to his prospects of domestic happiness. She felt the importance of his marrying some one with sufficient beauty and intelligence to restrain his somewhat errant fancy and win his respect as well as affection. 89 There were but few marriageable princesses in Europe at that time (Rudolf was then in his twentieth year), and the Emperor’s choice was far from satisfactory to Elizabeth, for it fell on the Belgian princess Stephanie, a seventeen-year-old girl of very ordinary mind and not at all attractive in appearance. Elizabeth had no liking either for King Leopold Second of Belgium or his wife, an Austrian archduchess, who played rather an unenviable role at her husband’s court, and bitterly opposed the match; but the Queen’s sister, the Archduchess Elizabeth (mother of the Queen Regent of Spain and a favorite cousin of the Emperor’s) brought all her influence to bear in her niece’s favor, and the Empress’ objections were overruled, Rudolf himself, meanwhile, seeming to regard the whole affair with perfect indifference. 90 The wedding took place May 10, 1881. All through the festivities that preceded the great event Elizabeth played her part perfectly as mother of the bridegroom, though her cold and distant manner toward her future daughter-in-law as well as the King and Queen of Belgium was only too evident. Part of the ceremonies consisted of a state procession through the streets of the capital, and during the whole progress she hardly spoke once to Queen Henriette, who rode beside her, but sat erect, bowing continuously in acknowledgment of the cheers of the populace, with a look almost of absentmindedness on her lovely face. In the middle of the marriage ceremony her self-control gave way completely, however, and she burst into a violent fit of weeping. This was her last public appearance in Vienna. Gay, frivolous, and fond of admiration, Stephanie was a princess to please the taste of the Viennese. Her arrival at court was hailed with delight, and when on the third of September, 1883, a daughter was born to the young couple, the public enthusiasm was a proof of their popularity. A change in the relations of Rudolf and his mother after his marriage was inevitable. Though he continued to make her his confidante, she was not long in discovering that he was far from happy in his marriage. Wretched over this unfortunate state of affairs and feeling less at home than ever in the Hofburg, she now rarely visited Vienna, sometimes spending only a few weeks there in the winter. CROWN PRINCE RUDOLF 91 She had never liked the Hofburg nor Schönbrunn, where the Emperor always spent the spring months, and now determined to have a residence of her own somewhere in the neighborhood of the capital. The spot chosen was the beautiful park of Lainz, hidden from the public gaze by high stone walls and further protected by a thick, impenetrable hedge surrounding the gardens. During the two years that “Waldesruhe,” as she called the Schloss, was being built it was rigidly guarded from intrusion of any kind, and even after it was finished no one but the servants and the family were allowed to enter the park or gardens. The building itself is in the style of the Renaissance, the façade adorned with balconies and terraces which in the Empress’ time were always a mass of flowers. A wide marble staircase covered with red velvet carpet led to the first floor, which contained the apartments of the Emperor and Empress, connected by a great salon or reception hall. Elizabeth’s spacious sleeping chamber was on the corner, with two windows to the east and two tall ones to the south, giving upon a balcony. The bed was placed in the centre of the room, protected at the head by a large screen, upon the reverse side of which was a painting of the Virgin Mary. A figure also representing the Blessed Virgin stood in one corner, holding in her hands a magnificent antique rosary. Opposite the bed was an exquisite statue of Niobe, the pedestal buried in growing plants and lighted with green incandescent lamps so arranged that as the Empress lay in bed she could see no light in the room but the green glimmer that fell on the Niobe. Breakfast was served on the balcony, which was like a flower garden. Here too in later years she placed a favorite work of art, a small reproduction of the marble statue of Heine made by the Danish sculptor Hasselriis for her villa Achilleon at Corfu. Adjoining her bedchamber and also giving upon the balcony was the Empress’ study, filled with photographs of her family and friends, and a picturesque litter of casts, sketches, bronzes, souvenirs of travel, and porcelain vases filled with flowers. Over the great square writing-table hung a striking portrait of her cousin King Ludwig Second of Bavaria. A fire was always burning on the wide hearth, and the Emperor and Empress used often to sit there together in the evenings watching the glowing logs and talking over the events of the day. The guest chambers and apartments of the Archduchess Marie Valerie were on the floor below, as was the Empress’ gymnasium. Physical exercise was so necessary to her that she always had a room fitted up in this way wherever she happened to be staying. 93 Another favorite retreat of Elizabeth’s was Miramar, the Emperor Maximilian’s palace, where for several years after his death she used to make frequent visits. Built of the purest white marble, it stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea, and near by is the pavilion used as a residence by the Empress Charlotte when she returned from Mexico a widow and hopelessly insane. At the time Elizabeth was first sent to Corfu to recuperate, the beauty of the country made a deep impression upon her, and her love for the shores of Greece after repeated visits in later years decided her to build a villa upon the island, the planning and furnishing of which should reflect her own individual taste. Near the idyllic village of Gasturi accordingly there rose the masterpiece of architecture which she called Achilleon. It stands on a hill facing the sea, the slopes of which are covered with olive and lemon trees and laid out as gardens on wide terraces. The house contains one hundred and twenty-eight rooms, filled with treasures of Greek and Pompeian art, and there are accommodations in the stables for fifty horses. All the rooms are filled with classic treasures. The Empress’ own apartments were entirely apart from the rest of the building, with a private entrance so that she could come and go at will. She used to rise at five and after her bath would go for a walk, usually alone, with a book under her arm. The mornings were devoted to study, the afternoons to long rambles. She knew every road for miles about, but loved best to explore the steepest and most dangerous mountain paths, the silent grandeur and beauty of the heights seeming to soothe for a time the restless cravings of her spirit. At nine she would retire after another bath in the marble basin which was brought from the Villa Borghese in Rome. Heine’s Book of Songs was always under her pillow, and often she would rise in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, and wander about through the dark avenues. At Achilleon, as elsewhere, she was most anxious to escape observation, and a high wall of marble with a screen of olive trees hid the palace from the public gaze. It was not people, however, that she disliked so much as being the object of their curiosity. “All I ask of people,” she often said, “is that they will leave me in peace.” 95 She was always kind and gracious to the poor, and the peasants used to kneel in the dust before her when she approached, calling aloud in their melodious language, “O Queen of Beauty, may God bless thine every step!” All heads were uncovered when she passed, and the children who watched for her coming would run to meet her with their hands full of blossoming orange and almond boughs. On the heights above Achilleon stood a monastery where she often used to go and talk with the monks. She asked one of them once if he ever went to the village. “There is always the marketing to do,” he answered. “Man is but human, and the body suffers from cold or hunger; but except for that, what should one do in the village? It is far better and more beautiful up here.” “That is true,” said the Empress; “undoubtedly you have chosen the better part.” 96 Chapter XV King Ludwig Second of Bavaria Through all her sorrows and troubles Elizabeth never lost her love for her Bavarian home or for her own family, with whom she corresponded regularly. For many years she was in the habit of spending part of every summer at Possenhoffen, revisiting the scenes of her childhood and going about among her peasant friends, who always spoke of her as “our Empress,” forgetful of the fact that this title properly belonged to the Queen of Prussia. 97 The years had brought many sorrows and misfortunes to Duke Max Joseph and his wife. Their oldest son married an actress of doubtful reputation. The Princess of Thurn and Taxis early lost her husband and oldest child and was left with the burden of managing the vast family estates. The third daughter, Marie, like Elizabeth, was elevated to a throne at the age of seventeen, by becoming the wife of Francis Second, King of the Two Sicilies; but barely a year later Garibaldi’s freelances robbed her unworthy husband of his crown and made her a queen without a country. A scarcely happier fate befell her sister Mathilde, who was married at eighteen to Count Louis of Trani, a broken-down roué who afterward died by his own hand. Neither of these Princesses had seen their husbands before their marriage. Sophie, Duchess d’Alençon, the youngest of the five sisters, was very beautiful and resembled the Empress Elizabeth in appearance, though not at all in disposition, for those who knew her as a young girl describe her as being full of animation and vivacity. She became engaged to her cousin Ludwig Second of Bavaria a year after his accession to the throne, and the betrothal met with general approval. He was a strikingly handsome young man of twenty at this time, and so desperately in love with his cousin that he had a bust made of her by a famous sculptor and placed in his winter garden where he could always look at it. Just before the wedding was to take place, however, he suddenly broke the engagement without a word of preparation or explanation, because he suspected that she was untrue to him. There is no doubt that the Princess was the victim of a deliberate plot to rob her of the King’s affection, but Ludwig made no attempt at reparation of any kind and his behavior made a breach between him and Duke Max’s family which was never healed. 98 Ludwig himself, fed by continual flattery and admiration and with a morbid idea of his own dignity, was deeply injured by the supposed faithlessness of his fiancée. In the first transports of his rage he seized the bust of the Princess and flung it out of the window, dashing it to pieces on the stones of the courtyard. Even at the beginning of his reign he had shown signs of mental unsoundness, but from this time he began to shun the society of his fellow creatures and lived a solitary life. He would have nothing more to do with women, and except for a few chosen companions would see no one. Even when obliged to receive his ministers, he would hide behind a screen. The only exception he made was in favor of his cousin Elizabeth, with whom he was a great favorite in spite of his erratic ways, and who also was devoted to him until his death. They were much alike in temperament as well as in appearance, and he always looked forward to her arrival each summer at Feldafing, near which was one of his favorite retreats, “Roseninsel,” a small island shut in by dense shrubbery and lofty trees. In olden times it had been the site of a heathen temple which was replaced later by a Roman Catholic chapel. The gardens, which were laid out by King Maximilian Second, were greatly enlarged and beautified by his son Ludwig and are said to contain sixteen thousand of the choicest varieties of roses, the perfume of which is wafted far out across the lake. The Hermitage, a small villa in the Italian style, and the gardener’s cottage are now the only buildings left in this wilderness of flowers, so overgrown that it is almost impossible to approach the little wharf where King Ludwig used to land from his yacht Tristan. Here he collected all his favorite authors and spent long happy days dreaming over them or working in the garden, and here too he and Elizabeth would meet and pour out their hearts to each other, alone and undisturbed. 99 After all, who can say with certainty where human reason ends and insanity begins? “I am not sure,” the Empress once said, in speaking of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “that those persons who are called mad are not the really wise ones.” King Ludwig’s eccentricities became so pronounced, however, that in 1886 he was forced to resign the government and was sent to Schloss Berg on Lake Starnberg under the care of a physician. One June evening they went out to walk together as usual, and when, after waiting in vain for their return, a search was made, the bodies of both were found at length at the bottom of the lake. Elizabeth happened to be staying at Feldafing when the catastrophe occurred and was deeply affected by the King’s tragic death. She hastened at once to the castle, and entering the room where his lifeless body lay, requested to be left alone with it. For an hour her attendants waited, and at length, alarmed at the delay, ventured to enter the apartment, where they found their mistress stretched upon the floor, apparently lifeless. It was only with the greatest difficulty that she was restored to consciousness, and when at last she did open her eyes, she stared wildly about her for some moments, then cried in a shaking voice: “For God’s sake, release the King from the mortuary chapel! He is not dead—he is only pretending to be so, that he may be left in peace and not tormented any longer.” 100 Ludwig’s body was carried back to Munich, where he lay in state, the bier heaped about with wreaths and floral offerings, but on the breast of the dead King lay a simple spray of jasmine, Elizabeth’s last gift to her friend and kinsman. 101 Chapter XVI The Empress’ Travels Urged by her love of nature and of new scenes as well as by her inborn restlessness, Elizabeth, as is well known, spent a great part of her time travelling about incognito from place to place like any ordinary tourist. She never tired of studying strange lands and peoples, and the constant change and communion with nature calmed her tortured spirit as nothing else could. “One should never stay indoors except when absolutely necessary,” she declared, “and our homes should be so ordered as not to destroy the illusions we bring in with us.” The sea had an irresistible attraction for her, and she would pace up and down the deck of her yacht for hours sometimes, ordering no one to speak to or approach her. “The sea is my father confessor,” she used to say; “it removes all my cares and troubles and has taught me all I know.” Her yacht Miramar, on which she spent so much of her time, was elegantly and conveniently fitted up with every comfort. On the deck was a large round pavilion of glass commanding a view of the sea in all directions, for her use in wet weather, but the Empress’ favorite spot was the after deck, which was shut off from the rest of the yacht with sail cloth so that there should be nothing to interfere with her outlook over the sea. 102 She usually travelled under the name of Countess of Hohenembs, her Majesty’s thirty-eighth title in the Court Calendar. She loved to explore strange, out-of-the-way places, and displayed wonderful enthusiasm and endurance as a traveller. Of all lands, however, she loved the East the best. Her favorite cities were Tunis, Algiers, Cairo, and Alexandria, and she was the first European sovereign to visit Troy. Her talent for languages was remarkable. Besides German and Hungarian, she had mastered French, English, and Greek, and had a fair knowledge of Latin. She never cared to learn Italian, indeed she had the greatest dislike to everything pertaining to Italy, having been subjected to several outrages at the hands of the people of that country. She had narrowly escaped death at Trieste in the early eighties, when a bomb was thrown into the citadel where she was staying. 103 Owing to the Empress’ reluctance to appear in public, her features were not generally known in Austria, a fact which led to many absurd situations. One day when taking the train at Mödling she sent her servant to order the station-master to have the train stopped at a small station near her palace at Lainz. Seeing that the train was about to start, she called to the guard: “Tell that man in the black coat to make haste!” Whereupon the officer bawled out, “Here, hurry up, you! or else your good woman will go off and leave you!” evidently taking the Empress for the horrified servant’s wife. It was not always easy to preserve her incognito on her travels, though she made every effort to do so because of her keen enjoyment of the adventures which it brought about. In her younger days she used to spend much time in Scotland and Ireland, where she delighted in the hunting. During one of these visits in Ireland the fox she was pursuing sprang over the wall of Maynooth College, near which the chase had led her, and dashed across the exercise ground where the students were sauntering peacefully about. Great was their amazement the next moment when the wall was also cleared by several hounds and a horsewoman on a magnificent hunter, who had evidently followed the fox through a pond, for she was dripping wet. The fox was quickly captured, and the rider dismounted and asked to see the head of the college, to whom she explained her identity, requesting to be shown to a room where she could change her clothes. No feminine garments were to be found, however, in a seminary for young priests and she was forced to borrow one of the doctors’ cassocks. While her clothes were drying she invited the professors to have tea with her, charmed them all with her graciousness, and caused much merriment by her comical appearance and lively descriptions of her adventures. 104 Once while in Amsterdam, where she occasionally went to be treated by an eminent specialist in nervous disorders, she entered a toy shop to buy a doll, saying to her companion: “I am sure my granddaughter will be delighted when she gets this.” The shop-keeper, thinking it impossible that this slender, youthful-looking person could be a grandmother, made some remark to that effect. “Oh, yes, I have four grandchildren,” said the Empress, “and to prove it I will come again soon and buy some toys for the other three. You may send them to my daughter, the Princess Gisela in Munich.” The poor shop-keeper was dumfounded and humbly apologized for his rudeness. “You were not rude,” said Elizabeth kindly; “on the contrary, you were very flattering.” 105 She was usually regarded as somewhat eccentric in Amsterdam, from her habit of always holding a fan before her face in the street, and once a street urchin ran up to her and snatched it away, crying, “Let me see your face!” But in spite of the unpleasant experiences which her incognito occasionally created, she could never be induced to abandon it and was much displeased when people did not respect her wishes in this matter. When one of the servants at a Spanish hotel, where she had registered as “Frau Folna of Corfu,” addressed her as “Your Highness,” she retorted sharply, “There are no Highnesses in my apartments.” She would often start off on the spur of the moment to see some work of art of which she had heard without telling any of her suite where they were going. Her Greek teacher, Professor Rhousso Rhoussopoulos, relates that on one occasion when the Empress was staying at Wiesbaden for the baths, he suddenly received orders to get ready to accompany herself and the Archduchess Marie Valerie on a journey, and not until they reached the railway station did he learn that their destination was Frankfort-on-the-Main, where Elizabeth wanted to see Thorwaldsen’s reliefs and Danecker’s “Ariadne,” which were in the Rothschild collection there. Luncheon had been ordered for them at the station restaurant at Frankfort. The Empress was in high spirits, and taking her daughter’s arm, walked up and down, watching the people and enjoying the bustle of the station. She was delighted that no one recognized her and ate the first part of her luncheon with great relish. But when the second course arrived it was specially served on gold plate with extra attendants; evidently her identity had been discovered. Instantly her cheerfulness vanished and she hastily finished the meal in order to escape as soon as possible. There was nothing she disliked so much as being stared at. 106 As Professor Rhoussopoulos was walking with her one day in a North German city, she suddenly exclaimed: “Look how that woman across the street is staring at us! What do you suppose it means?” “Probably it is only a bad habit she has, your Majesty,” replied the professor; but before the words were out of his mouth the Empress had rushed across the street and the next moment the two women were in each other’s arms. It was her sister, the Countess of Trani, who was almost as fond of travelling as Elizabeth herself. 107 Wherever she went the Empress was perpetually at warfare with the police authorities whose duty it was to watch over her safety. She resorted to all sorts of devices to elude and mislead them, and their task was no easy one. Once when she and the Emperor were staying at Mentone, she sent for the chief of police there and told him that it annoyed her exceedingly to be continually followed about by detectives and she wished it stopped. The officer replied that he was compelled to perform his duties, and if it displeased Her Majesty there was nothing left for him but to resign his position. “No, no!” said the Empress. “Remain in Mentone, by all means, and devote yourself to protecting my husband, for his life is most necessary to his subjects. As for me, what am I? A mere stranger and far too unimportant to attract any attention.” An English journalist was glancing over some books one day in front of a second-hand bookshop in Monza, when the dealer came out and asked him to go away, as the lady inside did not wish to be followed about, evidently supposing him to be a detective. Curious to know who the lady was, he cast a searching glance through the window and recognized the Empress. Taking out one of his cards, he handed it to the dealer with the request that he inform his illustrious customer of her mistake. An hour later, as he was strolling through the palace grounds, he saw Her Majesty a short distance in front of him. Not wishing to arouse her suspicions a second time, he was about to turn down a side path, when she beckoned him to approach and with much dignity and graciousness explained to him the annoyance she was subjected to by the officiousness of the police, and apologized for the scene at the bookshop. Late the next evening, as the journalist entered a well-known restaurant in Milan, great was his amazement to find the Empress seated at one of the tables quite alone and unattended. As he took his seat near by, one of the waiters came to her and said: 108 “It is rather late, signora, to get anything good; almost everything is gone.” “But I am hungry,” replied Elizabeth; “you will have to find me something.” The man disappeared and was back again in a moment. “There is just one course left, signora,” he said, “but it is the best of all. I can recommend it, for I have just eaten some of it myself. But it is a trifle dear!” “How much does this superior dish cost?” asked the Empress, smiling. “Eighty centesimi,” said the waiter doubtfully. Elizabeth laughed aloud. “The signora need not laugh,” he went on in an offended tone; “most people find it so dear they order only a half portion!” The journalist had sat all this time hidden behind his newspaper, but the Empress recognized him at once and addressing him pleasantly with “Good-evening, Herr Journalist,” continued to converse with him during the meal. 109 She was extremely fond of Paris and rarely failed to go there when on her European tours, though always as Countess of Hohenembs and never as Empress of Austria. She would often meet her sisters, the Duchess d’Alençon and the Countess of Trani, and go about with them, as she could do so there without fear of annoyance. One day she took a fancy to ride on an omnibus, but when the driver came to collect her fare she gave him two pieces of gold, an act of munificence that stunned the frugal Parisians and led to her being recognized. Annoyed at the curious interest of the other passengers, she hastily alighted and took refuge in the nearest house, where she waited till the crowd had dispersed and then drove back to her hotel in a closed carriage with the shades closely drawn, vowing it was the last time she would ever attempt to ride on an omnibus in a city like Paris. 110 Chapter XVII The Empress’ Literary Tastes Elizabeth was passionately fond of both music and poetry. From her father she had acquired a perfect mastery of the zither, but she had also a beautiful voice and was a piano pupil of Liszt, and often sung and played at court charity concerts. Her favorite composers were Rubinstein, Chopin, and Wagner, to the latter of whom she proved a true friend by sending him a large sum of money at one of his times of greatest need, and after his death she made one of her incognito trips to Bayreuth to hear the Wagner productions there. For art, too, she had the greatest enthusiasm. Both Makart and Munkacsy were warm personal friends of hers and she would often spend hours in their studios. She never went to the theatre in her later years, but always manifested great interest in the foremost actors and actresses in Austria and showed them many kindnesses on various occasions. 111 It was in literature, however, and poetry in particular, that she found her greatest inspiration and distraction. She was never without a book in her hand and would sit or wander about for hours so absorbed in her reading as to completely forget the passage of time, while as for her general knowledge competent judges have declared it to be amazing. “To converse intelligently with the Empress,” said Hasenauer, “one should be well versed in history, science, and art.” She translated the whole of Schopenhauer into modern Greek and was an earnest student of Rousseau and Voltaire. But her prime favorite in the literary world was Heinrich Heine, for whom she had the greatest reverence and admiration; she possessed all his works, many of them in manuscript, and many touching instances are told of her kindness to the great poet’s family. She had learned to love his poems soon after her marriage, in her first days of sorrow and disillusionment, and they always found a responsive echo in her heart. Anxious that his memory should be honored publicly, she interested herself in the erection of a monument to him in some German city, heading the subscription list herself with a large sum. The plan was in a fair way to succeed, when a letter arrived from Bismarck to the cabinet in Vienna, expressing his surprise that the ruler of a friendly neighboring country should wish to do public honor to a poet who had insulted the Hohenzollerns. As a rule, Franz Joseph and Elizabeth respected each other’s peculiarities and differences of taste, but in this case, on account of the Triple Alliance, the Emperor was obliged to ask his wife to remove her name from the list, and, thanks to this episode, it remains for the future to erect a monument to Heine in Germany. But Elizabeth was determined not to be thwarted and had her revenge, for, learning that the Danish sculptor Hasselriis in Rome had already prepared designs for a statue of her favorite poet, she commissioned him to execute it in marble and had it placed in front of her palace at Corfu. Apparently the Hohenzollerns did not resent this, however, for the then Emperor of Germany was most attentive to her whenever she was travelling in that country. He always made a point of calling upon her with his wife and is said to have considered her one of the cleverest women he ever met. 112 There were not many books that she cared for, but she loved to read her favorites again and again. Heine was the only one of the German poets whose works she understood and treasured. Neither Goethe nor Schiller appealed to her, nor did the modern French poets interest her, although she thought highly of Lamartine. In English she specially admired Shakespeare and Byron, Shakespeare indeed ranking only second to Heine in her affections. She made excellent translations of several of his plays and could repeat whole scenes from them by heart. “Hamlet” and “Midsummer Night’s Dream” were her favorites, and she had a painting of Titania and her lover with the ass’s head hanging in each of her palaces. “Our illusions are the asses’ heads that we all kiss,” she used to say. 113 She wrote charmingly herself, and while on the long journeys that consumed so much of her time she would send long letters every week to her husband and children, containing brilliant descriptions of her travels, bits of poetry or translations, often illustrated with exquisite pen-and-ink or water-color sketches. These valuable souvenirs are all preserved in the Hofburg, together with what she called her “day-book,” a sort of diary covering many years. 114 Chapter XVIII Daily Life of the Empress As time went on, the hereditary disease of the Wittelsbachs, now known as neurasthenia, which for generations had manifested itself in one form or another, became more and more pronounced in the Empress Elizabeth. Her passion for solitude, her aversion to mingling with people, and constant craving for change must certainly be regarded as inherited peculiarities, though she was more ill than was generally suspected. A complication of disorders together with neuritis made her later years a perpetual martyrdom, yet she bore her sufferings with a patience and fortitude that her physicians pronounced almost superhuman. It was a bitter sacrifice for her to give up her riding, but fortunately she was still able to take the walks and climbs that meant so much to her. Often, indeed, it was not so much the love of exercise as the effort to find relief in physical exhaustion from the sleeplessness that tortured her and secure the rest so necessary to her overwrought nerves. 115 Always a remarkably small eater, her tastes were extremely simple. For weeks at a time she would live on nothing but milk, and even at state banquets often took nothing but a slice or two of wheat bread, a cup of bouillon, and some fruit. She detested liquor of any sort, and never tasted it except when the physicians insisted upon her drinking a little wine for her health. As a rule, she had little respect for medical knowledge and much preferred to treat herself with her own remedies. She had a morbid horror of getting stout. Every day she had herself weighed, and if her usual weight increased at all she would live on oranges till it was reduced to the proper amount, in spite of her physicians’ warnings of the danger of so slender a diet. But although Elizabeth cared so little for eating, when at home she gave much attention to the menus presented to her each morning by the chef, which she often altered to suit herself. No table could be served more daintily and artistically than that of the Austrian court when the Empress was present. She selected the costliest porcelain and glass and had gold and silver services for all her palaces, though they were rarely used owing to her long absences. 116 Maria Theresa had sixteen children, and her son the Emperor Leopold Second seventeen; so the Austrian imperial family is a large one, aside from the numbers of foreign princes in Vienna who are related to the house of Hapsburg-Lorraine. But except on one or two state occasions in the course of the winter these distant connections rarely saw either Franz Joseph or Elizabeth. Absorbed in cares of state and caring for little but his shooting trips in later years, the Emperor led almost as solitary a life as his wife. When they were together with their children, the Empress always strove to make these reunions as happy and cheerful as possible, as if to make up in some degree for the family life her long absences deprived him of. They would spend long cosey evenings on the terraces or by the fireside, and Rudolf would often join the party, or, if the Emperor were busy, Elizabeth would entertain herself with Marie Valerie and some of her ladies-in-waiting. The court in general, however, kept aloof from her. Her manner was cold and forbidding to those she did not like, though her intimate companions had the deepest love and admiration for her and she was worshipped by her servants, none of whom was too humble to share her sympathy and interest. 117 One morning in Vienna it was learned that one of Elizabeth’s maids had died during the night, and very harsh comments were made on the fact of the Empress having been seen riding in the Prater on that very same afternoon. It was not told, however, that she had spent the whole of the previous night at the dying woman’s bedside, and it was only when death had ended the maid’s sufferings that the Empress had gone out into the fresh air. Nature endowed Elizabeth with great beauty, a noble nature, and a good mind; fate gave her wealth and the most exalted position a woman can occupy, and she seemed to have been destined for a life of ease and happiness. Perfect as she seemed in outward appearance, however, her character was full of contradictions. She loved nothing so much as freedom and solitude, yet when forced to appear in public, no princess in Europe could equal her for grace and majesty. Simple and economical in her own tastes and habits, in many respects she had no idea of money, as, for instance, when she furnished her cousin Ludwig of Bavaria with enormous sums to gratify his passion for building palaces. Her generosity was boundless, and wherever she went she scattered gifts and money broadcast. She never followed the freaks of fashion, yet her slender figure was the delight and envy of modistes. She dressed as simply as any of her attendants, but whatever she wore it was impossible to conceal her inborn dignity and air of distinction. Her favorite costume for every-day wear was a short, close-fitting skirt with loose waist, and she never put on her elaborate court dresses except when absolutely necessary, though even these always bore the stamp of her individuality. In her later years she was rarely seen in anything but black or white; on a few special occasions she would wear light gray or lilac, but never bright colors. Her hair never lost its beauty, though before her death it began to show a trace of silver here and there,—much to her annoyance, for she had a horror of growing gray. When loosened, it fell far below her knees and enveloped her like a mantle. She used to have it brushed for hours every day and often grew impatient of the trouble it caused her. 118 “My hair tires me,” she said one day to her Greek teacher, running her hands through its waves as if to relieve herself of a burden, “it is such a weight upon my head.” “It is Your Majesty’s crown!” was the courtly answer. “But not so easy to remove as the other kind of a crown!” she retorted with a melancholy smile. Another time she declared impatiently: “I am a perfect slave to my hair! I think I shall have it all cut off sometime.” But remarks such as these were made only in moments of annoyance and weariness. As a matter of fact, she was very proud of her magnificent tresses. It was almost the only sign of vanity she ever displayed. 119 Chapter XIX Death of Crown Prince Rudolf On the thirty-first of January, 1889, a terrible affliction befell the Emperor and Empress in the sudden and violent death of their only son. The tragedy of Mayerling is well known in its main points, and hundreds of different stories have been told concerning it, but the real circumstances of the affair are wrapped in impenetrable secrecy, and perhaps it is just as well if what the King of Belgium wrote to his brother, the Count of Flanders, is true. “Any report,” he said, “is better than that the real truth should be revealed.” All that is known with certainty is that the Crown Prince was found dead in his bed with a frightful wound in his head at his hunting lodge at Mayerling, near Vienna, where he had been spending a few days. In the same room lay the body of a young girl, the Baroness Vetsera, with whom he had been in love. It was difficult to believe that both had committed suicide, and there are facts which seem to indicate that Rudolf may have been murdered. The rest is all conjecture. 120 The unfortunate Prince was extremely popular with all classes and had many brilliant qualities, but after his marriage he developed habits which caused some anxiety as to his future. There was one person, however, who never lost faith in him, and that was his mother. She had wisely and carefully prepared him for the position he was to occupy in the world, and it was to her training and influence that he owed much of his early popularity. All Vienna was paralyzed with horror on the cold gray morning when word was brought from Mayerling of the Crown Prince’s death. No one knew just what had happened. No details of the affair were published and the confusion was indescribable. It was thought best to convey the news at once to the Empress, though many feared the shock might destroy her life or reason. As events proved, however, her mind and nerves were stronger than those of most people. She seemed stunned at first and turned away without speaking, her face drawn and colorless, but collecting herself she inquired in a dry, unnatural tone where her son was. Then her thoughts flew at once to her husband, who as yet knew nothing of what had happened. No one had the courage to tell him, but while the matter was being discussed Elizabeth stepped forward, pale but quite self-possessed, and declaring that it was her place to break it to the Emperor, left the room immediately. During the terrible days that followed the Empress gave ample proof, if it were needed, of her true nobility and strength of character. With heroic courage she stifled her own feelings to soothe and comfort her grief-stricken husband, and supported him bravely all through the endless ceremonies that accompanied the burial of their unfortunate child with whom so many hopes had perished. Well might Franz Joseph say, as he did when expressing his thanks to the people of Vienna for their sympathy: “What I owe to the courage and devotion of my beloved wife in this time of trouble, I can never adequately express, and I thank God with all my heart for bestowing on me so noble a consort.” Ten days later, the imperial pair, accompanied by Marie Valerie, left Vienna for Hungary. 121 Rudolf had been the first prince of the reigning house to give promise of being a really constitutional monarch. He wrote and spoke the Hungarian language like a native, was thoroughly familiar with all parts of the country, and well liked by both the people and the aristocracy. In his death Hungary suffered an irreparable loss, and throughout the kingdom there was genuine grief over his tragic fate, while the depth of public sympathy for the afflicted parents was shown in the warmth of the reception they received in Budapest. In a conversation with Dr. Christomanos some years before her death Elizabeth declared: “In every human life there is a moment when one dies inwardly and that need not necessarily be the time when death actually takes place.” This moment to her was when they brought her the news of her son’s death. She was never the same afterward. At the time of the catastrophe she had shown the courage of a heroine, but after her wonderful self-control had given way, the reaction was terrible and her despair heart-breaking. “I have no longer the strength to live nor the desire to die,” she said. It was reported in Berlin that her reason was destroyed, nor would it have been surprising if this had been the case after such a shock. Of course it was not true, but she did begin to develop symptoms of a serious heart trouble from which she suffered until her death. She never wished to see the Crown Princess Stephanie again, nor could she endure the presence of the little Archduchess Elizabeth, the grandchild who had inherited her father’s nature with the features of a mother to whose behavior the Empress attributed the changes in Rudolf’s way of life and his tragic fate. She shrank from contact with people more and more and often wounded her husband and children by her craving for solitude. Even her favorite palace of Lainz failed to attract her for more than a few weeks, while at Gödöllö the roses drooped and faded and the grass grew thick upon her once-loved bridle paths. EMPRESS ELIZABETH in later years 123 On the Christmas Eve following the death of the Crown Prince, her mother’s fifty-second birthday, the Archduchess Marie Valerie was betrothed to her cousin Franz Salvator, Duke of Tuscany, an event that was a cause of happiness and satisfaction to all concerned. Next to her parents’ blessing she was anxious to have that of her grandmother, and the day after Christmas accordingly she left for Munich, accompanied by her mother and her lover. Duke Max had died in 1888, shortly after the diamond wedding celebration at Possenhoffen, but the Duchess Ludovica, though bowed with age and many sorrows, had lost none of her mental acuteness and the meeting between the old lady and her daughter and granddaughter was most touching. From there they went to Wiesbaden and Heidelberg, where they spent the spring months. As they were returning to Vienna, they narrowly escaped death by the derailing of the train near Frankfort. Several of the coaches were overturned and crushed, but none of the imperial party, strange to say, was injured. Scarcely had the Empress reached home when she was called to Regensburg by the sudden death there of her eldest sister, Helene of Thurn and Taxis, and after the funeral she went again to Munich to comfort her grief-stricken mother. 124 The marriage of Marie Valerie and Franz Salvator that summer was one of the few happy events of Elizabeth’s later life. On that occasion she laid aside her mourning for a pale gray silk gown, and for the first time since Rudolf’s death made an effort to smile and appear cheerful. But the brief gleam soon vanished. The Archduchess had been the one bright spot in her life, and even though she was to remain in the country as the wife of an Austrian prince, Elizabeth realized that the relations between them could never be the same again. She had lost her dearest companion. On the twenty-fifth of January, 1892, her burden of sorrow was increased by the death of her mother, and she retired to Achilleon, where she had had a monument erected to her unfortunate son that she might be alone with memories of her beloved dead. Even her attendants saw her for only a short time each day, and she lived mostly in a world of dreams. Her favorite poets still afforded her solace and diversion, but she grew to care less for books than for the solitude, which she peopled with creations of her own fancy. Her reader sometimes tried to interest her in new authors, but her thoughts would soon wander and her absent expression prove the uselessness of such attempts. Only Shakespeare or Heine had power to fix her attention, and she would often interrupt her reading to recite favorite verses or passages to herself. 125 The only court ceremony at which the Empress appeared after the death of her son was on the occasion of the visit of the present Czar and Czarina of Russia to Vienna. Her presence at the state reception given in their honor excited even more interest and curiosity than did that of the young Czarina herself, and all eyes were fixed upon her as she entered on the arm of the Russian Emperor, smiling and bowing graciously to those about her. She was dressed in black, as usual, but looked twenty years younger than any of her contemporaries. In spite of all her sorrows and sufferings she could still be truthfully called the most beautiful woman at her court. But her thoughts were continually straying from her guests and from the brilliant scene about her. “There often seems to be a thick veil between me and the world, as if I were masquerading in the costume of an Empress,” she once remarked. “When I am with people I only show the part of me that we have in common, and they are surprised that I am so much like them when I talk about the weather and the price of candy. It is like taking a dress out of the wardrobe and putting it on for certain occasions.” 126 In 1896 Hungary celebrated her thousandth anniversary. Elizabeth was even more miserable than usual at the time, and did not feel that she could be present, but it was urged that her absence would cast a shadow over the festivities, and, ill as she was both in body and mind, she finally was persuaded and appeared beside her husband on the throne. Dressed all in black, with a long veil worn Hungarian fashion over her hair, she sat pale and motionless as a statue, her long eyelashes drooping and an expression of unspeakable sadness on her lovely face. Not a muscle moved as the speaker began his address of welcome. She seemed neither to see nor hear until he spoke the word “Elizabeth” and a mighty shout went up from the whole assembly that seemed to shake the marble walls of the throne room. Then the majestic head was lowered slightly, almost imperceptibly, but with wonderful grace and charm in acknowledgment of this tribute. Again the cheers rose louder than before and lasted several minutes, even the highest nobles of the kingdom waving their tufted kalpaks high in the air. 127 The Queen’s head sank, her deadly pallor giving place to a faint flush. Her eyes opened wide with a flash of their old brilliancy, and a tear rolled slowly down her cheek. It was plain that the affection between Elizabeth and her Hungarian subjects had undergone no change. The speaker went on with his address, the flush slowly faded from her cheeks, and soon she sat beside the Emperor, a Mater Dolorosa once more. It was her last visit to Hungary and her last appearance on the throne. 128 Chapter XX Death of the Empress The Empress Elizabeth had no fear of death, though the thought of it was often in her mind. “I am ready to die,” she used to say; “all I ask is that I may not live to suffer.” She had a presentiment that she was to die an unnatural death and believed it would be by drowning. Sometimes when walking along the shore or on the deck of her yacht she would say: “The sea will have me some day; I know I belong to it.” Her forebodings were destined to be fulfilled, though in a manner that neither she nor any one else could have foreseen, for the life that began so like a summer idyl ended in a tragedy. 129 In the Spring of 1897 a terrible fate befell her sister Sophie while assisting at a charity bazar held in Paris by the ladies of the French aristocracy. About four o’clock in the afternoon of the fourth of May the lamp of a cinematograph exploded, setting fire to some draperies. The hall was a flimsily built structure, and the flames spread with such rapidity that in a few moments the whole place was a sea of fire and the greater part of those present were unable to escape. One hundred and thirty people perished in this frightful disaster, among them the Duchess d’Alençon, Ludwig of Bavaria’s former fiancée. It was known that she must have perished, for her wedding ring was found among the ruins soon after the conflagration, though it was not till some days later that her body was found and identified. The Queen of Naples and Mathilde of Trani were now Elizabeth’s only surviving sisters, and of these the latter was her favorite. They had many traits in common, particularly their aversion to society and their love of travel. The Countess of Trani, who spent most of her time at hotels and watering-places, usually went by the modest title of “Fräulein Nelly Schmidt.” The last Christmas of Elizabeth’s life the two sisters spent together in Paris, but an acute attack of neuritis forced the Empress to hasten southward, and taking her yacht Miramar at Marseilles, they went to San Remo. Here they stayed for two months, leaving on the first of March for Territet in Switzerland, where they parted never to meet again. 130 Elizabeth was fond of returning to familiar places, and Lake Geneva was one of her favorite spots. From Territet she used to go every day by rail to Glion and from there on foot to Mont de Caux, accompanied only by one of her ladies or her reader, a young man named Frederick Barker. After a six weeks’ stay in Switzerland she returned to Vienna and went with the Emperor to Lainz. Never had her mind appeared so clouded as now. The veil of melancholia had settled over her thicker and heavier than ever. Her glance was restless, there was an unspeakable weariness in her expression, and hard and bitter lines had appeared about her mouth. Constant suffering made life a torment to her and she could find no rest day or night. Early in August she went as usual with her husband and Valerie’s family to Ischl to celebrate the Emperor’s birthday. It was the only day in the year on which she laid aside her mourning, and the imperial pair usually went together to church. This time, however, she left earlier and went to Mannheim to take some special massage treatment recommended by her physicians. Her health improved so much that she was able to eat and sleep again and to resume her excursions about the neighborhood, though still too weak to take the long walks and climbs she was so fond of. 131 On the twenty-ninth of August she went back to Switzerland, this time by special train to Mont de Caux, where she could be more quiet than at Territet. She seemed unusually well, and those who met the slender black-robed foreign lady, chatting familiarly with her one companion, little surmised that she was the sovereign of one of the greatest powers of Europe and ruler over more than forty million people. In a letter to the Emperor written at this time she expressed regret that he was not sharing the peace and pleasure of her stay here and urged him to join her, declaring that she was feeling so much better she hoped to be present at his approaching jubilee, the fiftieth anniversary of his accession to the throne. On the ninth of September she suddenly decided to make a visit to Pregny, a beautiful villa on the shores of Lake Geneva, that had once belonged to Joseph Bonaparte, but is now in the possession of the Rothschild family. The Baroness Adolph Rothschild had been very kind to the Queen of Naples in her days of misfortune, and Elizabeth was anxious to show her some attention. 132 She had gone for a stroll the preceding afternoon in the neighborhood of Territet with her reader, Mr. Barker, who had taken with him a basket of fruit for her refreshment. Seating herself on some moss-grown rocks, the Empress peeled a peach, half of which she offered to her companion. Just as she was in the act of handing it to him, a huge raven flew down from a tree near by, flapping its wings almost in her face and knocking the peach from her hand. Remembering the famous legend of the raven, which is always said to appear to the Hapsburgs as a forerunner of misfortune, the startled reader sprang to his feet in alarm and begged her to abandon the trip to Geneva. “I am not afraid, my friend,” replied Elizabeth. “We must all meet our fate sooner or later, and whatever is destined to happen will happen. Nothing we can do will alter it. You know I am a fatalist.” The next day she went to Pregny, as she had planned, accompanied only by her Hungarian lady-in-waiting, the Countess Sztaray. She was in a remarkably cheerful mood, most gracious and friendly with the Baroness and much pleased with her visit. Late in the afternoon she arrived at the Hôtel Beaurivage, where she was in the habit of staying. Every precaution had been taken as usual to preserve her incognito, though the servants, remembering her from former visits, were no doubt well aware of her identity. On her first arrival in Switzerland the police of the canton had been charged to watch over her safety, but she had wished as usual to be spared their espionage and left to go her own way. 133 At noon on the tenth of September, 1898, she left the hotel with her lady-in-waiting to take the steamer to Mont de Caux. They were a little late, and the Countess Sztaray hurried on in advance of her mistress to signal the captain to wait for them. Just at that moment a man arose from a bench on the quay where he had been sitting as they passed. It was the Italian Luigi Luccheni, a dangerous anarchist on whom the Swiss authorities had been warned to keep a watchful eye. With one bound he flung himself upon the Empress and plunged a dagger into her breast. The Countess was unaware that anything had happened, but turning just in time to see her mistress stagger, ran and caught her in her arms. “Is Your Majesty ill?” she asked in alarm. “I do not know,” said Elizabeth. “Will Your Majesty take my arm?” “Thank you. I do not think I need it.” 134 Though ghastly pale, she walked to the steamer without assistance, crossed the gang-plank, and then fell fainting to the deck. The steamer started, and the Countess Sztaray with some of the women on board endeavored to restore her to consciousness. No one suspected that she had been wounded until the Countess, loosening her dress to give her more air, discovered stains of blood on her clothing. Just then Elizabeth opened her eyes and in a clear, distinct voice asked, “What has happened?” then sank again into unconsciousness. Now thoroughly alarmed, the Countess informed the captain of her mistress’ identity, and the boat was turned back at once to Geneva, where Elizabeth was carried on a stretcher to the hotel and laid upon her bed. Three physicians who happened to be staying there at the time were hastily summoned and did all in their power to revive her, but in vain: about three o’clock she gave one or two deep sighs and passed away quietly and painlessly, as she had so often expressed a wish to do. So cold-blooded and unprovoked an assault in broad daylight and in the public street of a large city was one of the most shocking crimes of modern times and aroused the horror and indignation of the whole civilized world. Elizabeth of Austro-Hungary had no enemies. She had exerted no influence in politics, directly or indirectly, nor was she interested in state affairs. As her grief-stricken husband said of her, “she had done much good and never harmed a human being.” The Empress’ salon in the hotel was quickly transformed into a mortuary chapel. The walls were hung with black, tall candles placed about the coffin, at the foot of which knelt monks reciting prayers for the dead, and over the bier fell a purple velvet pall, in the corner of which some young Swiss girls had embroidered the words “Répose en paix.” Elizabeth was dressed as she had been in life, in black, her hands folded over a rosary and an ivory crucifix. The beautiful features were not altered, but had changed their look of suffering to an expression of wonderful majesty and peace. 135 On the evening of the eleventh of September a special train bearing her remains left Geneva and passed slowly through Switzerland and Austria amid the tolling of bells, and was met at every stop by sorrowing throngs eager to pay a last tribute to the dead Empress. The Emperor was overwhelmed with messages of sympathy from all parts of the globe. Flowers and funeral wreaths came from high and low alike in every land that she had visited. Even China and the Transvaal sent offerings to lay upon the Empress’ coffin. From Cairo came a wreath made of desert blooms, hundreds of Jericho roses, the old Christian emblem of the resurrection, and lotus blossoms, symbolic of eternity. Her death made almost as deep an impression in most of the foreign capitals as in Vienna, where for years she had been so little seen that her Austrian subjects had almost forgotten how she looked, and her assassination aroused less sorrow than rage against the wretch who could have slain a defenceless woman. 136 In Hungary, however, the public mourning was deep and profound. Every flag was at half-mast and the streets were full of sobbing men and women. The great autumn manœuvres were abandoned, and it was decreed that her biography should be recorded in the national archives, so that her memory might be forever preserved in the history of the country. The Empress Elizabeth’s personal fortune was a large one. Her jewels alone—presents from Franz Joseph and other royal personages—were valued at four million gulden. Her will was made at Budapest in 1896. It was very short and written in her own hand. Her palace at Lainz was bequeathed to her daughter Valerie; Achilleon, in Corfu, to the elder, Gisela. All her servants and ladies-in-waiting received legacies, and a number of old friends were also remembered. To her old reader and companion, Ida von Ferenczy, who had been with her for thirty years, she left an annuity, besides a considerable sum of money and a life residence in the imperial palace. In earlier days Elizabeth had expressed a wish to be buried at Gödöllö, then her favorite residence, but in her will she mentioned Achilleon as her chosen place of burial. Her desire was not fulfilled, however. Indulgent as Franz Joseph had been toward his wife’s eccentricities during her lifetime, he was not willing that her hatred of conventionality should be exhibited in her death, and determined that her body should be laid to rest with those of former Empresses and members of his family. 137 In the heart of Vienna there stands an insignificant-looking chapel belonging to the Capuchins. Above a side door are the words “Imperial Vaults,” and a flight of well-worn steps leads down into the dim burial-place of the royal race of Hapsburg. It was into this chamber that the great Maria Theresa used to force her gay young daughters to descend to meditate on the perishability of all earthly greatness, and here she herself would spend hours beside the tomb of her husband. At the end of a cross passage stands the tomb of the murdered Empress, between that of her brother-in-law, the murdered Emperor of Mexico, and her son Rudolf, who also met with a violent end. In life she had shunned all religious observances; now masses are said day and night for the repose of her soul. Every morning the gates of the crypt are opened, and she who in life so loved solitude and seclusion is a mark for the gaze of hundreds of curious sightseers. How much more fitting a place of rest for the nature-loving Empress the sunny shores of her Greek island would have been than the gloomy burial chamber of the Capuchins! How much finer a requiem the sighing of winds and waters than the chantings of vestured priests! 138 To the world in general Elizabeth of Austria and Hungary will be little remembered as the queenly sovereign in all the insignia of her lofty rank, but rather as the beautiful and unfortunate daughter of the Wittelsbachs, following her solitary way through life, her lonely spirit ever seeking rest and peace in vain. Terrible as it seemed to die by the hand of an assassin in a foreign country, far from all she loved, the dagger of Luccheni was but the instrument of fate, and death came to her almost as a friend. She died, as she had often wished to die, swiftly and painlessly and under the open sky. Who shall say that her last earthly breath was not a sigh of thankfulness and peace?

To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate. While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.']",3,"html,html,txt",29881.666666666668,False,,,,"the bed was an exquisite statue of Niobe, the pedestal buried in growing plants and lighted with green incandescent lamps so arranged that as the Empress lay in bed she could see no light in the room but the green glimmer that fell on the Niobe. Breakfast was served on the balcony, which was like a flower garden. Here too in later years she placed a favorite work of art, a small reproduction of the marble statue of Heine made by the Danish sculptor Hasselriis for her villa Achilleon at Corfu. Adjoining her bedchamber and also giving upon the balcony was the Empress’ study, filled with photographs of her family and friends, and a picturesque litter of casts, sketches, bronzes, souvenirs of travel, and porcelain vases filled with flowers. Over the great square writing-table hung a striking portrait of her cousin King Ludwig Second of Bavaria. A fire was always burning on the wide hearth, and the Emperor and Empress used often to sit there together in the evenings watching the glowing logs and talking over the events of the day. The guest chambers and apartments of the Archduchess Marie Valerie were on the floor below, as was the Empress’ gymnasium. Physical exercise was so necessary to her that she always had a room fitted up in this way wherever she happened to be staying. 93 Another favorite retreat of Elizabeth’s was Miramar, the Emperor Maximilian’s palace, where for several years after his death she used to make frequent visits. Built of the purest white marble, it stands on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea, and near by is the pavilion used as a residence by the Empress Charlotte when she returned from Mexico a widow and hopelessly insane. At the time Elizabeth was first sent to Corfu to recuperate, the beauty of the country made a deep impression upon her, and her love for the shores of Greece after repeated visits in later years decided her to build a villa upon the island, the planning and furnishing of which should reflect her own individual taste. Near the idyllic village of Gasturi accordingly there rose the masterpiece of architecture which she called Achilleon. It stands on a hill facing the sea, the slopes of which are covered with olive and lemon trees and laid out as gardens on wide terraces.

She was the wife of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, although she was not the First Lady in 1976, when Obasanjo was military head of state. She died while undergoing elective liposuction abroad.[1] She was a political activist in her own right, supporting causes such as women\'s liberation, youth as leaders of tomorrow, and the rehabilitation of a war-torn Nigeria.[2] Early life and education[edit] Stella Abebe was born on 14 November 1945, she was from Iruekpen, Esan West, Edo State. Her father, Dr. Christopher Abebe, was chief of the United Africa Company (UAC) who became the first indigenous (African) chairman of UAC Nigeria.[3][4] She began her education at Our Lady of the Apostles Primary School. She enrolled at St. Theresa\'s College, where she obtained her West African School Certificate in 1964 with grade one. Two years later she obtained the higher school certificate. She was admitted to the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University), Ile-Ife, for a bachelor\'s degree in English, attending from 1967 to 1969. In 1969 she transferred to the UK to complete her studies, this time round, in insurance, in London and Edinburgh, Scotland, from 1970 to 1974.[citation needed] She completed her education with a certificate as confidential secretary from Pitman College in 1976. She returned to Nigeria in 1976.[citation needed] Personal life[edit] She married General Obasanjo with whom she had one son; Olumuyiwa Obasanjo born in 1977.[citation needed] Olusegun Obasanjo had just become Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces, following the assassination of General Muritala Mohammed.[5][6] First Lady of Nigeria[edit] When she became Nigeria\'s First Lady in 1999, following the election of her husband as president, Obasanjo established Child Care Trust, for the care of underprivileged and/or disabled children.[7][8] As First Lady of Nigeria, Obasanjo joined the Campaign Against Female Genital Mutilation and on 6 February 2003, she declared the day the International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation.[9][10] Reporters Without Borders reported that Orobosa Omo-Ojo, the publisher of the Lagos-based Nigerian Midwest Herald, was arrested on Stella Obasanjo\'s orders on 2 May 2005 and taken to Akure prison. His arrest was prompted by an article the previous week about her, headlined ""Greedy Stella"".[11] Death[edit] Obasanjo died at age 59 from complications of cosmetic surgery at a private health clinic in Puerto Banús, Marbella, Spain, on 23 October 2005. The surgeon, identified only as ""AM"" in court, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment in September 2009 on a charge of ""causing homicide through negligence"", disqualified from medicine for a period of three years and ordered to pay €120,000 (approximately US$176,000) in compensation to Stella Obasanjo\'s son.[12] Prosecutors had requested a two-year jail term and five-year disqualification.[13] A request for compensation for the Nigerian government was also rejected.[14] The physician had misplaced a tube designed for a liposuction procedure into Obasanjo\'s abdominal cavity.[15] She sustained a punctured colon and lacerated liver[12][15] and died two days after the surgery.[16] The doctor did not immediately answer his mobile phone when called after performing the operation and reportedly left Obasanjo for four hours.[12][15] Had she been hospitalised in time, it is thought she might have survived her injuries.[17][18] Nigeria portal References[edit] ^ ""Surgeon jailed over death of First Lady"".

The main reforms that were passed include the\xa0Affordable Care Act\xa0(commonly referred to as ACA or ""Obamacare""), although without a\xa0public health insurance option, the\xa0Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the\xa0Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The\xa0American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\xa0and\xa0Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010\xa0served as economic stimuli amidst the\xa0Great Recession. After a\xa0lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the\xa0Budget Control\xa0and the\xa0American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in\xa0Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia\xa0New START\xa0treaty, and\xa0ended military involvement\xa0in the\xa0Iraq War. He ordered\xa0military involvement in Libya\xa0for the implementation of the\xa0UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of\xa0Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operation that resulted in the\xa0killing of Osama bin Laden. After winning\xa0re-election\xa0by defeating Republican opponent\xa0Mitt Romney, Obama was\xa0sworn in for a second term\xa0in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for\xa0LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the\xa0Supreme Court\xa0to strike down\xa0same-s*x marriage\xa0bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor\xa0and\xa0Obergefell v. Hodges); same-s*x marriage was\xa0legalized\xa0nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in\xa0Obergefell. He advocated for\xa0g*n control\xa0in response to the\xa0Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on\xa0assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning\xa0global warming\xa0and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered successful\xa0military interventions in Iraq\xa0and\xa0Syria\xa0in response to gains made by\xa0ISIL\xa0after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of\xa0ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan\xa0in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015\xa0Paris Agreement\xa0on global climate change, initiated\xa0sanctions against Russia\xa0following the\xa0invasion in Ukraine\xa0and again after\xa0interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, brokered the\xa0JCPOA nuclear deal with Iran, and\xa0normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated\xa0three justices to the Supreme Court:\xa0Sonia Sotomayor\xa0and\xa0Elena Kagan\xa0were confirmed as justices, while\xa0Merrick Garland\xa0faced partisan\xa0obstruction\xa0from the Republican-led\xa0Senate\xa0led by\xa0Mitch McConnell, which never held hearings or a vote on the nomination. Obama left office in January 2017 and continues to reside in\xa0Washington, D.C.[2][3] During Obama\'s terms in office, the United States\' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved.[4]\xa0Obama\'s presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among\xa0the upper tier\xa0of American presidents. Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[5]\xa0at\xa0Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children\xa0in\xa0Honolulu,\xa0Hawaii.[6][7][8]\xa0He is the only president born outside the\xa0contiguous 48 states.[9]\xa0He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother,\xa0Ann Dunham\xa0(1942–1995), was born in\xa0Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[10]\xa0with some German, Irish, Scottish,[11]\xa0Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[12]\xa0In July 2012,\xa0Ancestry.com\xa0found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from\xa0John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the\xa0Colony of Virginia\xa0during the seventeenth century.[13][14]\xa0Obama\'s father,\xa0Barack Obama Sr.\xa0(1934–1982),[15][16]\xa0was a married[17][18][19]\xa0Luo Kenyan\xa0from\xa0Nyang\'oma Kogelo.[17][20]\xa0Obama\'s parents met in 1960 in a\xa0Russian language\xa0class at the\xa0University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[21][22]\xa0The couple married in\xa0Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[23][24] In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the\xa0University of Washington\xa0in\xa0Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack\'s father completed his undergraduate degree in\xa0economics\xa0in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at\xa0Harvard University, where he earned an\xa0M.A.\xa0in economics. Obama\'s parents divorced in March 1964.[25]\xa0Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[26]\xa0He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[27]\xa0before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[28]\xa0Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.""[22]\xa0He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[29] In 1963, Dunham met\xa0Lolo Soetoro\xa0at the\xa0University of Hawaii; he was an\xa0Indonesian\xa0East–West Center\xa0graduate student\xa0in\xa0geography. The couple married on\xa0Molokai\xa0on March 15, 1965.[30]\xa0After two one-year extensions of his\xa0J-1 visa, Lolo returned to\xa0Indonesia\xa0in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the\xa0Tebet\xa0sub district of\xa0south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the\xa0Menteng\xa0sub district of\xa0central Jakarta.[31] At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his step-father. From age six to ten, he attended local\xa0Indonesian-language\xa0schools:\xa0Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi\xa0(St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and\xa0Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01\xa0(State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language\xa0Calvert School\xa0homeschooling by his mother.[33][34]\xa0As a result of his four years in\xa0Jakarta, he was able to speak\xa0Indonesian\xa0fluently as a child.[35][36][37]\xa0During his time in Indonesia, Obama\'s stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him ""a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.""[38] In 1971, Obama returned to\xa0Honolulu\xa0to live with his maternal grandparents,\xa0Madelyn\xa0and\xa0Stanley Dunham. He attended\xa0Punahou School—a private\xa0college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[39]\xa0In his youth, Obama went by the nickname ""Barry"".[40]\xa0Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,\xa0Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in\xa0anthropology\xa0at the\xa0University of Hawaii.[41]\xa0Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at\xa0Punahou\xa0when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[42]\xa0His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a\xa0PhD\xa0degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for\xa0ovarian\xa0and\xa0uterine cancer.[43] Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.""[44]\xa0Obama has also written and talked about using\xa0alcohol,\xa0m*******a, and\xa0cocaine\xa0during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind.""[45]\xa0Obama was also a member of the ""choom g**g"", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[46][47] After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to\xa0Los Angeles\xa0to attend\xa0Occidental College\xa0on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the\xa0disinvestment from South Africa\xa0in response to that nation\'s policy of\xa0apartheid.[48]\xa0In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in\xa0Pakistan\xa0and\xa0India\xa0for three weeks.[48]\xa0Later in 1981, he\xa0transferred\xa0to\xa0Columbia University\xa0in\xa0New York City\xa0as a\xa0junior, where he majored in\xa0political science\xa0with a specialty in\xa0international relations[49]\xa0and in\xa0English literature[50]\xa0and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[51]\xa0He graduated with a\xa0Bachelor of Arts\xa0degree in 1983 and a 3.7\xa0GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the\xa0Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[52][53]\xa0then as a project coordinator for the\xa0New York Public Interest Research Group\xa0on the\xa0City College of New York\xa0campus for three months in 1985.[54][55][56] Family and personal lifeMain article:\xa0Family of Barack ObamaIn a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of\xa0his extended family: ""It\'s like a little mini-United Nations,"" he said. ""I\'ve got relatives who look like\xa0Bernie Mac, and I\'ve got relatives who look like\xa0Margaret Thatcher.""[57]\xa0Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father\'s family—six of them living.[58]\xa0Obama\'s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,\xa0Madelyn Dunham,[59]\xa0until her death on November 2, 2008,[60]\xa0two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in\xa0Moneygall\xa0in May 2011.[61]\xa0In\xa0Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother\'s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of\xa0Jefferson Davis,\xa0President of the Confederate States of America\xa0during the\xa0American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with\xa0George W. Bush\xa0and\xa0d**k Cheney, among others.[62][63][64] Obama lived with anthropologist\xa0Sheila Miyoshi Jager\xa0while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[65]\xa0He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[65][66]\xa0The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[66] In June 1989, Obama met\xa0Michelle Robinson\xa0when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of\xa0Sidley Austin.[67]\xa0Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama\'s adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[68]\xa0They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[69]\xa0After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent\xa0in vitro fertilization\xa0to conceive their children.[70]\xa0The couple\'s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[71]\xa0followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001.[72]\xa0The Obama daughters attended the\xa0University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the\xa0Sidwell Friends School.[73]\xa0The Obamas had two\xa0Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named\xa0Bo, was a gift from Senator\xa0Ted Kennedy.[74]\xa0In 2013, Bo was joined by\xa0Sunny, a female.[75]\xa0Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[76] Obama is a supporter of the\xa0Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the\xa02005 ALCS\xa0when he was still a senator.[77]\xa0In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the\xa0All-Star Game\xa0while wearing a White Sox jacket.[78]\xa0He is also primarily a\xa0Chicago Bears\xa0football fan in the\xa0NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a\xa0fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in\xa0Super Bowl XLIII\xa012 days after he took office as president.[79]\xa0In 2011, Obama invited the\xa01985 Chicago Bears\xa0to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their\xa0Super Bowl win\xa0in 1986 due to the\xa0Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[80]\xa0He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school\'s varsity team,[81]\xa0and he is left-handed.[82] In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a\xa0Hyde Park, Chicago\xa0condominium to a $1.6\xa0million house (equivalent to $2.1\xa0million in 2020) in neighboring\xa0Kenwood, Chicago.[83]\xa0The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend\xa0Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko\'s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[84] In December 2007,\xa0Money Magazine\xa0estimated Obama\'s net worth at $1.3\xa0million (equivalent to $1.6\xa0million in 2020).[85]\xa0Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\xa0million—up from about $4.2\xa0million in 2007 and $1.6\xa0million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[86][87]\xa0On his 2010 income of $1.7\xa0million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to\xa0Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans\' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[88][89]\xa0Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10\xa0million.[90] In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband\'s smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.[91][92] On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in\xa0Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a\xa0feminist.[93][94][95] Religious viewsObama is a\xa0Protestant\xa0Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[96]\xa0He wrote in\xa0The Audacity of Hope\xa0that he ""was not raised in a religious household."" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person\xa0... I have ever known"", and ""a lonely witness for\xa0secular humanism."" He described his father as a ""confirmed\xa0atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" Obama explained how, through working with\xa0black churches\xa0as a\xa0community organizer\xa0while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.""[97] In January 2008, Obama told\xa0Christianity Today: ""I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the\xa0redemptive death\xa0and\xa0resurrection of Jesus\xa0Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.""[98]\xa0On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I\'m a Christian by choice. My family didn\'t—frankly, they weren\'t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn\'t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers\' and sisters\' keeper,\xa0treating others as they would treat me.[99][100] Obama met\xa0Trinity United Church of Christ\xa0pastor\xa0Jeremiah Wright\xa0in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[101]\xa0During Obama\'s first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after\xa0some of Wright\'s statements were criticized.[102]\xa0Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including\xa0Shiloh Baptist Church\xa0and\xa0St. John\'s Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at\xa0Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[103][104][105] In 2016, he said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him ""of all the different people I\'ve met along the way"", adding: ""I carry these around all the time. I\'m not that superstitious, so it\'s not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times."" The items, ""a whole bowl full"", include rosary beads given to him by\xa0Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity\xa0Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small\xa0Buddha statue\xa0given by a monk, and a silver poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a biker in Iowa.[106][107] Law careerCommunity organizer and Harvard Law SchoolTwo years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the\xa0Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in\xa0Roseland,\xa0West Pullman, and\xa0Riverdale\xa0on Chicago\'s\xa0South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[55][108]\xa0He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants\' rights organization in\xa0Altgeld Gardens.[109]\xa0Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the\xa0Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[110]\xa0In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his\xa0paternal relatives\xa0for the first time.[111][112] Despite being offered a full scholarship to\xa0Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at\xa0Harvard Law School\xa0in the fall of 1988, living in nearby\xa0Somerville, Massachusetts.[114]\xa0He was selected as an editor of the\xa0Harvard Law Review\xa0at the end of his first year,[115]\xa0president of the journal in his second year,[109][116]\xa0and research assistant to the constitutional scholar\xa0Laurence Tribe\xa0while at Harvard for two years.[117]\xa0During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a\xa0summer associate\xa0at the law firms of\xa0Sidley Austin\xa0in 1989 and\xa0Hopkins & Sutter\xa0in 1990.[118]\xa0After graduating with a\xa0JD\xa0degree\xa0magna c*m laude[119]\xa0from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[115]\xa0Obama\'s election as the\xa0first black president of the\xa0Harvard Law Review\xa0gained national media attention[109][116]\xa0and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[120]\xa0which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as\xa0Dreams from My Father.[120] University of Chicago Law School and civil rights attorneyIn 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the\xa0University of Chicago Law School\xa0to work on his first book.[120][121]\xa0He then taught\xa0constitutional law\xa0at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a\xa0lecturer\xa0from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[122] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois\'s\xa0Project Vote, a\xa0voter registration campaign\xa0with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading\xa0Crain\'s Chicago Business\xa0to name Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be.[123] He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an\xa0associate\xa0for three years from 1993 to 1996, then\xa0of counsel\xa0from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in\xa0Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).[124]\xa0This\xa0class action lawsuit\xa0was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices f*******n under the\xa0Equal Credit Opportunity Act\xa0and the\xa0Fair Housing Act.[125]\xa0The case was settled out of court.[126]\xa0Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.[127] From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the\xa0Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the\xa0Joyce Foundation.[55]\xa0He served on the board of directors of the\xa0Chicago Annenberg Challenge\xa0from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[55] Free reading for new users Scan code to download appdownload_iosApp StoreGoogle PlayFacebookexpand_moreic_arrow_leftic_arrow_rightWriterchap_listContentslikeADD', 'Barack Obama -

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American president. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate, a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in international diplomacy, a decision which drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts; legislation to reform health care; and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the Iraq War and ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. Obama downplayed Bush\'s counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. Obama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan in the 2012 presidential election. In his second term, Obama advocated for gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, took steps to combat climate change, signing the Paris Agreement, a major international climate agreement, and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. He initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (a nuclear agreement with Iran), and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama\'s second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout the remainder of his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage. Obama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington, D.C., and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in Biden\'s successful presidential bid in the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020). His presidential library began construction in the South Side of Chicago in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. Early life and career Main article: Early life and career of Barack Obama Obama (right) with grandfather Stanley Armour Dunham, mother Ann Dunham, and half-sister Maya Soetoro, mid-1970s in Honolulu Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[2] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[3][4][5][6] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[7] He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850.[8] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[9][10][11] Obama has described the ancestors of his grandparents as Scotch-Irish mostly.[12] Obama\'s father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[13] was a married[14][15][16] Luo Kenyan from Nyang\'oma Kogelo.[14][17] His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent.[18] Obama\'s parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[19][20] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[21][22] In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack\'s father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama\'s parents divorced in March 1964.[23] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[24][page\xa0needed] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[25] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[26] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.""[20] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[27] In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaiʻi; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[28] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.[29] Education Obama\'s Indonesian school record in St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School. Obama was enrolled as ""Barry Soetoro"" (no. 1), and was wrongly recorded as an Indonesian citizen (no. 3) and a Muslim (no. 4).[30] When he was six years old, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as ""Barry""[30] and attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[31][32] As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama\'s stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him ""a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works"".[34] In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[35] In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname ""Barry"" which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980.[36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[39] Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered\xa0— to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect\xa0— became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.""[40] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind"".[41] Obama was also a member of the ""Choom Gang"" (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.[42][43] College and research jobs After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation\'s policy of apartheid.[44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks.[44] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[45] and in English literature[46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[47] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[48][49] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[50][51][52] Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago\'s South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[51][53] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants\' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[54] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[55] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[56][57] External videos Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34, Boston TV Digital Archive[58] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25. Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[59] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[60] president of the journal in his second year,[54][61] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard.[62] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[63] Obama\'s election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[54][61] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[64] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[64] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude.[65][60] University of Chicago Law School In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[64][66] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[67] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois\'s Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain\'s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be.[68] Family and personal life Main article: Family of Barack Obama In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: ""It\'s like a little mini-United Nations,"" he said. ""I\'ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I\'ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.""[69] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father\'s family, six of them living.[70] Obama\'s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[71] until her death on November 2, 2008,[72] two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[73] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother\'s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.[74][75][76] Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.[77] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.[77][78] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.[78] Obama poses in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, September 2009 In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed at Sidley Austin.[79] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama\'s adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.[80] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[81] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children.[82] The couple\'s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,[83] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001.[84] The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[85] The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[86] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[87] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[88] Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[89] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[90] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.[91] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[92] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school\'s varsity team,[93] and he is left-handed.[94] In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6\xa0million house (equivalent to $2.6\xa0million in 2024) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[95] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko\'s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[96] In December 2007, Money Magazine estimated Obama\'s net worth at $1.3\xa0million (equivalent to $2\xa0million in 2024).[97] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\xa0million—up from about $4.2\xa0million in 2007 and $1.6\xa0million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[98][99] On his 2010 income of $1.7\xa0million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans\' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[100][101] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10\xa0million.[102] Religious views Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[103] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he ""was not raised in a religious household."" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person\xa0... I have ever known"", and ""a lonely witness for secular humanism."" He described his father as a ""confirmed atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.""[104] The Obamas worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013 In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: ""I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.""[105] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying: I\'m a Christian by choice. My family didn\'t—frankly, they weren\'t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn\'t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers\' and sisters\' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.[106][107] Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[108] During Obama\'s first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright\'s statements were criticized.[109] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John\'s Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.[110][111][112] In 2016, Obama said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him ""of all the different people I\'ve met along the way"", adding: ""I carry these around all the time. I\'m not that superstitious, so it\'s not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times."" The items, ""a whole bowl full"", include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.[113][114] Legal career From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation.[51] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[51] Obama\'s law license became inactive in 2007.[115][116] Legislative career Illinois Senate (1997–2004) Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama State senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998 Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic state senator Alice Palmer from Illinois\'s 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[117] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[118][119] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[120] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican governor George Ryan\'s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[121][122] He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[123][124] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois\'s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[125] In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate\'s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[126] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[120][127][128][129] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[130] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[131] 2004 U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois Main article: 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois Obama campaign yard sign in Chicago, c.\u2009November 2004 In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[132] Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration\'s 2003 invasion of Iraq.[133] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[134] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[135] and spoke out against the war.[136] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd ""it\'s not too late"" to stop the war.[137] Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.[138] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[139] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[140] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[141] Obama\'s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[142] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[143] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history.[144] He took 92 of the state\'s 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not perform well.[145] U.S. Senate (2005–2008) See also: US Senate career of Barack Obama and List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[146] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[147] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[148] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[149] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[150] He also cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[151] In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[152][153] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[154][155] Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[156] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[157] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran\'s oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;[158] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[159] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[160] Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, and Veterans\' Affairs through December 2006.[161] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[162] He also became Chairman of the Senate\'s subcommittee on European Affairs.[163] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[164] Obama resigned his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[165] Presidential campaigns 2008 presidential candidacy Main articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama 2008 presidential primary campaign, 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and 2008 United States presidential election 2008 electoral vote results. Obama won 365–173. On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[166][167] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his ""House Divided"" speech in 1858.[166][168] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.[169] Obama in 2008, during his presidential campaign Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but Obama gained a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[170] On June 2, 2008, Obama had received enough votes to clinch his nomination. After an initial hesitation to concede, on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[171] On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his selection of Delaware senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[172] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana governor and senator Evan Bayh and Virginia governor Tim Kaine.[172] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[173][174] Obama delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide.[175][176][177] During both the primary process and the general election, Obama\'s campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[178] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[179] John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[180] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[181] Obama won 52.9 percent of the popular vote to McCain\'s 45.7 percent.[182] He became the first African-American to be elected president.[183] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago\'s Grant Park.[184][185] He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others being Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.[186] 2012 presidential candidacy Main articles: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign, 2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and 2012 United States presidential election 2012 electoral vote results. Obama won 332–206. On April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled ""It Begins with Us"" that he posted on his website.[187][188][189] As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[190] and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[191] At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former president Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[192] On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[193][194][195] With 51.1 percent of the popular vote,[196] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice.[197][198] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago\'s McCormick Place after his reelection and said: ""Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.""[199][200] Presidency (2009–2017) Main article: Presidency of Barack Obama For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Barack Obama presidency. First 100 days Main article: First 100 days of Barack Obama\'s presidency Obama takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John Roberts at the Capitol, January 20, 2009 Official portrait, 2009 The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[201] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[202] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[203][204] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee.[205] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[206] He also revoked President George W. Bush\'s restoration of President Ronald Reagan\'s Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[207] Domestic policy See also: Social policy of the Obama administration The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[208] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children.[209] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop ""strict guidelines"" on the research.[210] Obama delivers a speech at a joint session of Congress with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009 Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring associate justice David Souter. She was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[211] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent.[212] Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.[213] On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden. In July 2009, Obama launched the Priority Enforcement Program, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the Secure Communities fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.[214] In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[215] Obama visits an Aurora shooting victim at University of Colorado Hospital, 2012 On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[216] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[217] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.[218] In a 2016 editorial in The New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed ""common-sense gun reform"" to women\'s suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history. In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.[219] Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,[220] but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy.[221][222] Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms.[223] He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA\'s ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).[223] Racial issues See also: Race and ethnicity in the United States In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[224][225] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[226] Following Obama\'s election, many pondered the existence of a ""post-racial America"".[227][228] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent,[227][229] and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama.[230] The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that ""Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.""[231] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a wave of protests.[232] These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people.[232] Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.[233] Several incidents during Obama\'s presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama\'s condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama\'s expressions of empathy for the police.[234] In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried ""a great deal"" about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.[235] LGBT rights On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim\'s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[236] On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[237] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[238][239] to end the don\'t ask, don\'t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.[240] Same-sex marriage As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage.[241] During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.[242] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating ""I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.""[243] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[244][245] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[200] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word ""gay"" in an inaugural address.[246][247] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[248] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[249] Economic policy Main article: Economic policy of the Obama administration On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\xa0billion (equivalent to $1153 billion in 2024) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[250] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[251] In March 2009, Obama\'s Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the 2008 financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2\xa0trillion in depreciated real estate assets.[252] Deficit and debt increases, 2001–2016 Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[253] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms\' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[254] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.[255] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[256] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as ""Cash for Clunkers"", which temporarily boosted the economy.[257][258][259] The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5\xa0trillion, but only $3\xa0trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.[260] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation\'s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5\xa0trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2\xa0trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.[261] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[262] The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[263] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[264] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent,[265] decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013.[266] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter.[266] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter.[267] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[267] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was ""unusually uncertain"".[268] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.[269] U.S. unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment during Obama\'s tenure as president[266][270]Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to other presidents, as measured as a cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama\'s stimulus plan for economic growth.[271][272] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1\xa0million,[272][273][274] while conceding that ""it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.""[271] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[275] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II.[276] The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.[277] Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[278] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858\xa0billion (equivalent to $1.2 trillion in 2024) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[279] In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a ""defining challenge of our time"" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis\' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[280] Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[281] Environmental policy See also: Climate change policy of the United States and Energy policy of the Obama administration Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP oil spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[282] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[283] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.[284] In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he ""would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.""[285][286] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.[287] It was the third veto of Obama\'s presidency and his first major veto.[288] In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.[289][290][291] Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000\xa0ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.[292][293][294] Health care reform Main article: Healthcare reform in the United States Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[295] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900\xa0billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[296][297] Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level, under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (source: CRS)[298] On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[295] After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[299] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[300] On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[301][302] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[303] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially ""Obamacare"") passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[304] The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percent\xa0of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[305] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percent\xa0of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum ""out-of-pocket"" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,[306] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[307] Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (source: JAMA)[308] The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[309] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[310] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143\xa0billion over the first decade.[311] The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress\'s taxing authority.[312] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that ""closely-held"" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans ""established by the State"", as the statute reads.[313] Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of the Obama administration June 4, 2009 − after his speech A New Beginning at Cairo University, U.S. president Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others Jamal Khashoggi, Bambang Harymurti and Nahum Barnea In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a ""new era"" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms ""break"" and ""reset"" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[314] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya.[315] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year\'s video message to the people and government of Iran.[316][317] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for ""A New Beginning"" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[318] On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government\'s actions towards protesters following Iran\'s 2009 presidential election.[319] In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam suspected of being a leading Al-Qaeda organizer. al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike. The\xa0Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki\'s death as a lawful act of war,[320] while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki\'s constitutional right to due process. The killing led to significant controversy.[321] His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate U.S. military actions, although they were not targeted specifically.[322][320] Obama, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and other leaders at the GCC summit in Saudi Arabia, April 2016 In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a ""Joint Planning Cell"" with Saudi Arabia.[323][324] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115\xa0billion.[325] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen\'s capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.[326] In September 2016 Obama was snubbed by Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party as he descended from Air Force One to the tarmac of Hangzhou International Airport for the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit without the usual red carpet welcome.[327] War in Iraq Main articles: Iraq War and US-led intervention in Iraq (2014–2021) On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months.[328] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop\'s levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[329][330] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[331] On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be ""home for the holidays.""[332] In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.[333][334] In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL.[335] By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict[336] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.[337] In early 2015, with the addition of the ""Panther Brigade"" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400,[338] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.[339] Afghanistan and Pakistan Main articles: War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) and AfPak Obama after a trilateral meeting with Afghan president Hamid Karzai (left) and Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari (right), May 2009 In his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a ""dangerous distraction"" and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan,[340] the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again.[341] Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to ""stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan"", an area he said had not received the ""strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.""[342] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal\'s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[343] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[344] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal\'s staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[345] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.[346] In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.[347] Regarding neighboring Pakistan, Obama called its tribal border region the ""greatest threat"" to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he ""cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary."" In the same speech, Obama claimed that the U.S. ""cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy.""[348] Death of Osama bin Laden Main article: Killing of Osama bin Laden Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on Operation Neptune\'s Spear in the White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011.

Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56\xa0km) from Islamabad.[349] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[349] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a ""surgical raid"" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[349] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[350][351] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden\'s corpse,[352] which was buried at sea several hours later.[353] Within minutes of the President\'s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City\'s Ground Zero and Times Square.[350][354] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[355] Relations with Cuba Main article: Cuban thaw Obama meeting with Cuban president Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015 Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.[356] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.[357] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.[358] In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.[359] Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be ""Obama\'s finest foreign policy achievement.""[360] On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana.[361] The countries\' respective ""interests sections"" in one another\'s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.[362] Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.[363] Israel See also: Israel–United States relations §\xa0Obama administration (2009–2017) Obama meeting with Israeli president Shimon Peres in the Oval Office, May 2009 During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.–Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[364] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[365] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[366][367] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[368] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[369] In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama\'s view, ""with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.""[370] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: ""To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I\'ve been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.""[371] Obama expressed support for Israel\'s right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[372] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was ""dangerous"" and ""bad.""[373] On December 23, 2016, under the Obama administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[374] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration\'s actions,[375][376] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6\xa0million, on January 6, 2017.[377] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[378][379] Libya Main articles: 2011 military intervention in Libya and 2012 Benghazi attack In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[380] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[381] In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire. However Gaddafi\'s forces continued to attack the rebels.[382] On March 19, a multinational coalition led by France and the United Kingdom with Italian and U.S. support, approved by Obama, took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government\'s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[383] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[384][385][386] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[387] Some members of Congress[388] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[389][390] In 2016 Obama said ""Our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind"" and that it was ""a mess"".[391] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government\'s overthrow was the ""worst mistake"" of his presidency.[392] Syrian civil war See also: Foreign involvement in the Syrian civil war §\xa0United States, and US intervention in the Syrian civil war On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: ""The time has come for President Assad to step aside.""[393] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[394] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[395] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[396][397] In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the ""red line"" he had pledged[398] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[399][400] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.[401] Iran nuclear talks See also: Iran–United States relations during the Obama administration and Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Obama talks with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 2013 On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The ""Complex Modernization"" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the ""Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[402][403][404] In addition, the transfer of $1.7\xa0billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the ""effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.""[405] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration\'s Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[406][407] On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348\xa0billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[408] Russia See also: Russia–United States relations §\xa0Obama administration (2009–2017) Obama meets Russian president Vladimir Putin in September 2015 In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[409] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[410] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[411] In August 2013, he criticized Russia\'s law that discriminates against homosexual people,[412] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[413] After Russia\'s invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[414] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had ""allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West"", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[415] Post-presidency (since 2017) Obama playing golf with Argentinian president Mauricio Macri, October 2017 Obama\'s presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump.[416][417] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[418] On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama ""for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.""[419] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.[420] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[421] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation,[422] which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[423] Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas\' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions.[424][425] Higher Ground\'s first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020.[426] On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials.[427] In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha\'s Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[428] On October 29, Obama criticized ""wokeness"" and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation\'s annual summit.[429][430] Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee.[431] On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has ""all the qualities we need in a president right now.""[432][433] In May, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis ""an absolute chaotic disaster"", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been ""our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.""[434] On November 17, Obama\'s presidential memoir, A Promised Land, was released.[435][436][437] Obama and his wife attended the inauguration of Joe Biden in January 2021. In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about ""their backgrounds, music and their \'enduring love of America.\'""[438][439] Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle\'s Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[440] Obama with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House, April 5, 2022 On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land.[441] On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.[442][443][444] In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible.[445][446] In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle\'s official White House portraits.[447] Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator[448] for his narration in the Netflix documentary series Our Great National Parks.[449] In 2022, Obama opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.[450] In March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time.[451] Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.[452][453] In October 2023, during the Gaza war, Obama declared that Israel must dismantle Hamas in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on Israel.[454] Weeks later, Obama warned Israel that its actions could ""harden Palestinian attitudes for generations"" and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war\'s human costs ""could ultimately backfire.""[455] Obama in 2025. In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden\'s campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump.[456] On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her.[457] He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, senator, and vice president and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets.[458][459] After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President–elect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.[460] Obama attended the second inauguration of Donald Trump in January 2025.[461] Cultural and political image Main article: Public image of Barack Obama See also: International media reaction to the 2008 United States presidential election Obama\'s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who rose to prominence in the 1960s through their involvement in the civil rights movement.[462] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that ""we\'re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.""[463] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, remarking: ""I wouldn\'t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.""[464] Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator.[465] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly video addresses on YouTube.[466] Job approval Graph of Obama\'s approval ratings per Gallup According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating,[467] the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in.[468] His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009[469] and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s,[470] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan\'s and Bill Clinton\'s first years in office.[471] Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.[472][473][474] His approval rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011[475] before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent.[476] After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama\'s approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent[477] before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December.[472] In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama\'s approval ratings were at their lowest[478][479] with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent.[472][480][481] His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year.[472][482] According to Gallup, Obama\'s approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013.[472][483] In polling conducted January 16–19, 2017, Obama\'s final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.[484] Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency.[485] In Gallup\'s retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.[486][487] Foreign perceptions Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[488][489][490] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[491] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[492][493] On October 9, 2009—only nine months into his first term—the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"",[494] which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[495][496][497][498] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[499] He himself called it a ""call to action"" and remarked: ""I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations"".[500] Legacy and recognition Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century.[501][502][503] Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with ""a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals."" Zeitzer notes Obama\'s policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama\'s term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama ""turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder."" Zeitzer calls this the ""defining paradox of Obama\'s presidency"".[504] The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed ""only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama\'s presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.""[505] David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short ""in areas many Progressives hold dear"", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama\'s legacy that of ""a disappointingly conventional president"".[506] Obama\'s most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a ""skinny repeal"", have thus far failed.[507] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.[508] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system\'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[509][510][511][512] Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[507] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3\xa0million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term.[513] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[514] In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[515] As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[516] In 2010, he signed the Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to ""don\'t ask, don\'t tell"" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year.[517] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[518][240] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama\'s term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama\'s eight years in office.[519] Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[520] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[521][522] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[523] According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody of any president since Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[524] Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama\'s human rights record ""mixed"", adding that ""he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.""[223] Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.[525][526] He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.[527] In Gallup\'s 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.[486] Presidential library Main article: Barack Obama Presidential Center The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama\'s planned presidential library.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000. In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as ""Obamacare""; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In January 2011, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation\'s debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Obama was reelected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California\'s Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, and has sought to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba.

Obama\'s parents met in 1960 in a Russian class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.[7][8] The couple married in Wailuku on Maui on February 2, 1961,[9][10] and separated when, in late August 1961, Obama\'s mother moved with their newborn son to attend the University of Washington in Seattle for one year. In the meantime, Obama, Sr. completed his undergraduate economics degree in Hawaii in June 1962, then left to attend graduate school at Harvard University on a scholarship. Obama\'s parents divorced in March 1964.[11] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964 where he remarried; he visited Barack in Hawaii only once, in 1971.[12] He died in an automobile accident in 1982 when his son was 21 years old.[13] In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii, and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[14] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966, followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967, with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet subdistrict of south Jakarta, then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta.[15] From ages six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School for two years and Besuki Public School for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[16] Obama with his half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, mother Ann Dunham and grandfather Stanley Dunham, in Honolulu, Hawaii Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham, and with the aid of a scholarship attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.[17] Obama lived with his mother and sister in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[18] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[19] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer.[20] Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.""[8] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[21] Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.""[22] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind"".[23] Obama was also a member of the ""choom gang"", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[24][25] After high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles in 1979 to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation\'s policy of apartheid.[26] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks.[26] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[27] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[28] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1983 and worked for a year at the Business International Corporation,[29] then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.[30][31] In 1985, Obama was among the leaders of May Day efforts to bring attention to the New York City Subway system, which was in a bad condition at the time. Obama traveled to several subway stations to get people to sign letters addressed to local officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and was photographed at the City College subway station holding a sign protesting the system\'s condition.[32] Community organizer and Harvard Law School Two years after graduating, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago\'s South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[31][33] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants\' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[34] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.[35] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[36][37] He returned to Kenya in 1992 with his fiancée Michelle and his half-sister Auma.[36][38] He returned to Kenya in August 2006 for a visit to his father\'s birthplace, a village near Kisumu in rural western Kenya.[39] Obama entered Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988. He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[40] president of the journal in his second year,[34][41] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.[42] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[43] After graduating with a J.D. magna cum laude[44] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.[40] Obama\'s election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[34][41] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[45] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[45] University of Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.[45][46] He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[47] From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois\'s Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain\'s Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be.[48] He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. His law license became inactive in 2007.[49][50] From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.[31] He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.[31] Legislative career (1997–2008) As Illinois State Senator (1997–2004) Main article: Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998 Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding State Senator Alice Palmer as Senator from Illinois\'s 13th District, which at that time spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park\xa0– Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.[51] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.[52] He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.[53] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan\'s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[54] He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002.[55] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois\'s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[56] In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate\'s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[57] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.[53][58] During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.[59] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.[60] U.S. Senate campaign Main article: United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004 County results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois. Obama won the counties in blue. In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race; he created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.[61] Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration\'s 2003 invasion of Iraq.[62] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,[63] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,[64] and spoke out against the war.[65] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd that ""it\'s not too late"" to stop the war.[66] Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates.[67] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.[68] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention,[69] seen by 9.1\xa0million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.[70] Obama\'s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.[71] Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.[72] In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70\xa0percent of the vote.[73] As U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08) Main article: United States Senate career of Barack Obama Obama in his official portrait as a member of the United States Senate Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,[74] becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.[75] CQ Weekly characterized him as a ""loyal Democrat"" based on analysis of all Senate votes in 2005–2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.[76] Legislation See also: List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate Obama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.[77] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;[78] and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.[79] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.[80] Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.[81] Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.[82] Obama and U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)[83] In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.[84] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.[85] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,[86] and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.[87] Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.[88] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.[89] He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran\'s oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.[90] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.[91] Committees Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans\' Affairs through December 2006.[92] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.[93] He also became Chairman of the Senate\'s subcommittee on European Affairs.[94] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.[95] Presidential campaigns 2008 presidential campaign Main articles: United States presidential election, 2008, Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008 and Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008 Obama stands on stage with his wife and daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in Springfield, Illinois, February 10, 2007 On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[96][97] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic ""House Divided"" speech in 1858.[96][98] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[99] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[100] A large number of candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.[101] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.[102] President George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the Oval Office on November 10, 2008 On August 23, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.[103] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine.[104] At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.[105] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of over 75,000; the speech was viewed by over 38\xa0million people worldwide.[106][107] During both the primary process and the general election, Obama\'s campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.[108] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.[109] John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and the two engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.[110] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.[111] Obama won 52.9% of the popular vote to McCain\'s 45.7%.[112] He became the first African American to be elected president.[113] Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago\'s Grant Park.[114] 2012 presidential campaign Main articles: United States presidential election, 2012 and Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012 Mitt Romney and President Obama shake hands in the Oval Office on November 29, 2012, following their first meeting since President Obama\'s reelection On April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled ""It Begins with Us"" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission.[115][116][117] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries,[118] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.[119] At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton, as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.[120] On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.[121][122][123] With 51.1% of the popular vote,[124] Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to twice win the majority of the popular vote.[125][126] President Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago\'s McCormick Place after his reelection and said: ""Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.""[127][128] Presidency Main article: Presidency of Barack Obama See also: Confirmations of Barack Obama\'s Cabinet and List of presidential trips made by Barack Obama First days Barack Obama takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol, January 20, 2009 The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[129] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[130] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[131][132][133] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[134] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[135] He also revoked President George W. Bush\'s restoration of President Ronald Reagan\'s Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.[136] Domestic policy Main article: Barack Obama social policy The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.[137] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children\'s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4\xa0million uninsured children.[138] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy which had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop ""strict guidelines"" on the research.[139] Obama delivering a speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009 Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. Sonia Sotomayor, nominated by Obama on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter, was confirmed on August 6, 2009,[140] becoming the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.[141] Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three, for the first time in American history.[142] On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.[143][144] On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim\'s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[145][146] On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill which ends the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increases the Pell Grant scholarship award, and makes changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[147][148] In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.[149] Obama meets with the Cabinet, November 23, 2009 On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don\'t Ask, Don\'t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, fulfilling a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[150][151] to end the Don\'t ask, don\'t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.[152] President Obama\'s 2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised that the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and would be 80% reliant on ""clean"" electricity.[153][154] As a candidate for the Illinois state senate Obama had said in 1996 that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage;[155] but by the time of his run for the U.S. senate in 2004, he said that while he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, for strategic reasons he opposed same-sex marriages.[156] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for reelection as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[157][158] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[128] Obama called for full equality for gay Americans: ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law\xa0— for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" This was a historic moment, being the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word ""gay"" in an inaugural address.[159][160] In 2013 the Obama administration filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[161] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[162] On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[163][164] White House advisory and oversight groups On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which forms part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by Executive Order 13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.[165] The Council is currently chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett.[166] Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through an official United States government memorandum on January 22, 2014 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.[166][167][168] The current co-chairs of the Task Force are Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.[167] The Task Force has been a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that, the 1994 Violence Against Women Act that was first-drafted by Biden.[169] Economic policy Main article: Economic policy of Barack Obama Play media Obama presents his first weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\xa0billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[170] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.[171] In March, Obama\'s Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two\xa0trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.[172] Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry[173] in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms\' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[174] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.[175] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[176] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as ""Cash for Clunkers"", that temporarily boosted the economy.[177][178][179] Deficit and Debt increases 2001-2013 Spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5\xa0trillion, but only $3\xa0trillion was spent by the end of November 2009.[180] Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5\xa0trillion or 10.6% of the nation\'s gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4\xa0trillion or 9.9% of GDP.[181][182] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to $1.34\xa0trillion, while the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53\xa0trillion or 90% of GDP.[183] The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2\xa0trillion took effect in February 2014.[184] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation\'s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5\xa0trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2\xa0trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.[185] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[186] Employment statistics (changes in unemployment rate and net jobs per month) during Obama\'s tenure as U.S. President[187][188] As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.[189] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.[190] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,[191] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.[192] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.[193] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.[194] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.[194] In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was ""unusually uncertain"".[195] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.[196] The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama\'s stimulus plan for economic growth.[197][198] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1\xa0million,[198][199][200][201] while conceding that ""It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.""[197] Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.[202] Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes.[203] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.[204] In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a ""defining challenge of our time"" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis\' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.[205] Environmental policy See also: Climate change policy of the United States Obama at a 2010 briefing on the BP Oil Spill at the Coast Guard Station Venice in Venice, Louisiana On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. The well\'s operator, BP, initiated a containment and cleanup plan, and began drilling two relief wells intended to stop the flow. Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet, and again on May 28 and June 4. On May 22, he announced a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. On May 27, he announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[206] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[207] In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and stated he ""would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution"" or ""greenhouse emissions"".[208][209] Obama\'s advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.[210] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would authorize the pipeline.[211] It was the third veto of Obama\'s presidency and his first major veto.[212] Health care reform Main article: Health care reform in the United States Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010 Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.[213] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900\xa0billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.[214][215] On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.[213] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.[216] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.[217] Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and federal poverty level, under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source: CRS) On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.[218][219] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.[220] On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.[221] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.[222] The ACA includes health-related provisions to take effect over four years, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,[223] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum ""out-of-pocket"" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 9.5% of income,[224][225] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and Congressional Budget Office figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.[224][226] The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[227] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.[228] In March 2010, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.[229] The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the Commerce Clause does not allow the government to require people to buy health insurance, but the mandate was constitutional under the US Congress\'s taxing authority.[230] In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that ""closely-held"" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. Energy policy Main article: Energy policy of the Obama administration Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly based ""All of the above"" approach to domestic energy policy which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.[231] Obama\'s approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy such as coal mining and oil fracking has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of nation\'s available energy resources.[232][233] Gun control President Obama at University of Colorado Hospital visiting 2012 Aurora shooting victims On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, President Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control.[234] He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.[235] 2010 midterm elections Main articles: United States House of Representatives elections, 2010 and United States Senate elections, 2010 Obama called the November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,[236] ""humbling"" and a ""shellacking"".[237] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.[238] Foreign policy Main article: Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration Obama speaking on ""A New Beginning"" at Cairo University on June 4, 2009 In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a ""new era"" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms ""break"" and ""reset"" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.[239] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.[240] On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year\'s video message to the people and government of Iran.[241][242] In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.[243] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for ""A New Beginning"" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.[244] On June 26, 2009, in response to the Iranian government\'s actions towards protesters following Iran\'s 2009 presidential election, Obama said: ""The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.""[245] On July 7, while in Moscow, he responded to a Vice President Biden comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: ""We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.""[246] On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.[247] In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.[248][249] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.[250] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[251] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[252] He criticized Russia\'s law discriminating against gays in August 2013,[253] stopping short of advocating a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.[254] In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between Cuba and the United States.[255] Iraq Main article: Iraq War On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, ""Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.""[256] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop\'s levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.[257][258] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.[259] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be ""home for the holidays"".[260] In June 2014, amid territorial gains made by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant following the U.S. withdrawal in 2011, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.[261] Meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit War in Afghanistan Main article: War in Afghanistan (2001–present) Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.[262] He announced an increase to U.S. troop levels of 17,000 in February 2009 to ""stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan"", an area he said had not received the ""strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires"".[263] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal\'s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.[264] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;[265] this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal\'s staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.[266] In February 2013 Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 US troops by February 2014.[267] Israel Obama meeting with Israeli President Shimon Peres, 2009 In June 2012, Obama said that the bond between the United States and Israel is ""unbreakable.""[268] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.[269] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.[270] In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.[271] Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.[272] In 2013, one journalist reported that, in Obama\'s view, ""with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.""[273] War in Libya Main article: 2011 military intervention in Libya In March 2011, as forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[274] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[275] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to ""show no mercy"" to the rebels of Benghazi[276]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,[277] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling Misrata. The next day, on Obama\'s orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government\'s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[278] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[279][280][281] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all of its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[282] Some Representatives[283] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[284][285] Osama bin Laden Main article: Death of Osama bin Laden President Obama on Osama bin Laden\'s Death Play media President Obama\'s address (Full Text) President Obama on Osama bin Laden\'s Death Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.

President Barack Obama along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune\'s Spear, in the White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also: The Situation Room (photograph) Starting with information received in July 2010, intelligence developed by the CIA over the next several months determined what they believed to be the location of Osama bin Laden in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles from Islamabad.[286] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[286] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a ""surgical raid"" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[286] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, resulting in the death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[287][288] DNA testing identified bin Laden\'s body,[289] which was buried at sea several hours later.[290] Within minutes of the President\'s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City\'s Ground Zero and Times Square.[287][291] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush,[292] and from many countries around the world.[293] Cultural and political image Main article: Public image of Barack Obama See also: International media reaction to the United States presidential election, 2008 and International reactions to the United States presidential election, 2012 Obama\'s first term presidential portrait (2009) Obama\'s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[294] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough,"" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that ""we\'re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.""[295] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""I wouldn\'t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.""[296] Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[297] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[298] Obama conducting the first completely virtual interview from the White House in 2012[299] According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating[300] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,[301] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan\'s and Bill Clinton\'s first years in office.[302] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after Osama bin Laden\'s death on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[303][304] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.[305] Despite him dropping to 39% in his approval ratings in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, he has climbed to 50% in late January 2015 according to the Gallup Organization.[306] Polls show strong support for Obama in other countries,[307] and before being elected President he met with prominent foreign figures including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair,[308] Italy\'s Democratic Party leader and Mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni,[309] and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.[310] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[311] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[312][313] G8 leaders watching the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final Obama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.[314] His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video ""Yes We Can"", which was viewed 10\xa0million times on YouTube in its first month[315] and received a Daytime Emmy Award.[316] In December 2008 and in 2012, Time magazine named Obama as its Person of the Year.[317] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which Time described as ""the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments"".[318] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the UK Parliament in Westminster Hall, London. This was only the 5th occurrence since the start of the 20th century, of a head of state being extended this invitation, following Charles de Gaulle in 1960, Nelson Mandela in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.[319][320] On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"".[321] Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with ""deep gratitude and great humility.""[322] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[323][324][325][326][327][328][329] Obama\'s peace prize was called a ""stunning surprise"" by The New York Times.[330] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[331] Family and personal life Main article: Family of Barack Obama Obama posing in the Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia in 2009 In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: ""It\'s like a little mini-United Nations"", he said. ""I\'ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I\'ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.""[332] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband) and seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father\'s family\xa0– six of them living.[333] Obama\'s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,[334] until her death on November 2, 2008,[335] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[336] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother\'s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.[337] Besides his native English, Obama speaks some basic Indonesian, having learned the language during his four childhood years in Jakarta.[338][339] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school\'s varsity team;[340] he is left-handed.[341] Obama taking a shot during a game on the White House basketball court, 2009 Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.[342] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the all star game while wearing a White Sox jacket.[343] He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President.[344] In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.[345] In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.[346] Assigned for three months as Obama\'s adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.[347] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.[348] The couple\'s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,[349] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), on June 10, 2001.[350] The Obama daughters attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private Sidwell Friends School.[351] The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs, the first, a male named Bo, a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[352] In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[353] Applying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6\xa0million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.[354] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko\'s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.[355] In December 2007, Money estimated the Obama family\'s net worth at $1.3\xa0million.[356] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5\xa0million—up from about $4.2\xa0million in 2007 and $1.6\xa0million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.[357][358] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans\' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.[359][360] As per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.[361] Obama tried to quit smoking several times, sometimes using nicotine replacement therapy, and, in early 2010, Michelle Obama said that he had successfully quit smoking.[362][363] Religious views Obama and First Lady worship at African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013 Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.[364] He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he ""was not raised in a religious household"". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as ""non-practicing Methodists and Baptists""), as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known."" He described his father as a ""confirmed atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.""[365] In January 2008, Obama told Christianity Today: ""I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.""[366] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying ""I\'m a Christian by choice. My family didn\'t—frankly, they weren\'t folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn\'t raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers\' and sisters\' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.""[367][368] Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright in October 1987, and became a member of Trinity in 1992.[369] He resigned from Trinity in May 2008 during his first presidential campaign after some of Wright\'s statements were criticized.[370] After a prolonged effort to find a church to attend regularly in Washington, Obama announced in June 2009 that his primary place of worship would be the Evergreen Chapel at Camp David.[371] Notes and references Notes ^ ""President Barack Obama"".

Radhakrishnan Personal detailsBorn(1913-02-22)22 February 1913Lucknow, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, British IndiaDied19 November 1988(1988-11-19) (aged\xa075)Delhi, IndiaAlma materCambridge University Mirza Hameedullah Beg (M. H. Beg) (22 February 1913 – 19 November 1988[1]) was the 15th Chief Justice of India, serving from January 1977 to February 1978. Early life and education[edit] Born into a Deccani Muslim family, his father Mirza Samiullah Beg was the Chief Justice of Hyderabad State, making him an important figure in Hyderabad state affairs. He was the real uncle of internationally acclaimed beautician Shahnaz Husain. As was the case with many children of aristocracy in Hyderabad at the time, Mirza Hameedullah Beg attended St. George\'s Grammar School, where he earned a gold medal for securing first position in Senior Cambridge H.S.L.C. Examination. As India was still under heavy British influence, it was common for wealthy Indians to receive higher education in England, particularly when studying law. Thus, M.H. Beg joined the renowned Trinity College and Cambridge University in 1931, and earned Honours in Archaeological and Anthropological and Historical Triposes. He studied law, economics and politics at the London School of Economics. He joined the bar through the Honourable Society of Lincoln\'s Inn. He was called to the Bar in England in 1941. Judicial career[edit] After graduation, M.H. Beg returned to India to begin practising as an Advocate for the Allahabad High Court, at Allahabad and Meerut. From here, M.H. Beg began working up experience in the judicial system. In 1949, he enrolled as an Advocate of the Federal Court of India, and eventually he became an Advocate of the Supreme Court of India. After building up an extensive practice on all sides he became Standing Counsel to the U.P. Sunni Central Wakf Board and appeared frequently for Municipal bodies. Beg was raised to the Bench of the Allahabad High Court on 11 June 1963. As judge, he sat on the Criminal and Civil sides as well as on the Tax Bench. Later, he was appointed Company Judge and became in charge of the matrimonial and testamentary jurisdiction of the High Court from the middle of 1967 to 1970. Shortly after territories were redrawn and the state of Himachal Pradesh was established, M.H. Beg was appointed Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court in January 1971.[2] After a short term as Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court, Beg was elevated to Judge of the Supreme Court of India on 12 December 1971. Over the course of his Supreme Court tenure, Beg authored 194 judgments and sat on 562 benches. [3] By being Chief Justice of India, he also administered oath of office to 6th President of India Neelam Sanjiva Reddy. Habeas Corpus case[edit] Beg was also involved in the Habeas Corpus case. This landmark case in Indian democracy, Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla, came up in 1975 during the Indian Emergency. The legal question hinged on the citizen\'s right to judicial scrutiny for arrests under emergency. The five seniormost judges of the Supreme court heard the case, and four aligned with the government view that even the right to life stood suspended during emergency (only dissent was H. R. Khanna). In his April 1976 decision, Justice Beg observed: We understand that the care and concern bestowed by the state authorities upon the welfare of detenues [sic?] who are well housed, well fed and well treated, is almost maternal.[4] A few months later, in January 1977, M.H. Beg, who was junior to H. R. Khanna, was appointed Chief Justice of India by the Indira Gandhi government. This was against legal tradition, though it had started with A. N. Ray\'s appointment. This impingement into the independence of the judiciary was widely protested;[5] subsequent law ministers, particularly Shanti Bhushan, initiated a series of measures to bring judicial appointments within the power of the Chief Justice, and not the executive. After Mohammad Hidayatullah, Beg was the second Muslim Chief Justice in India. After a one-year term, Beg retired in February 1978. Subsequently, Beg served as chairman of the Minorities Commission of India.[6][7] Academics[edit] While practising as an Advocate, Beg took on various faculty positions teaching various subjects: Professor, Constitutional Law and Equity at Meerut College (1943–1946) Taught Law of Evidence, Human Law, and Ancient Law at Allahabad University(1946–1963) Standing Counsel to the Allahabad University Member of the International Law Association and of the World Association of Judges Since retirement, Beg has written two books discussing Muslim politics in India: Impact of Secularism on Life and Law, published in 1985 Human Rights and Asia, published in 1978 Awards[edit] 1988: Padma Vibhushan India\'s second highest civilian award for his contribution towards Law and Public Affairs References[edit] ^ George H.

H. Beg) (22 February 1913 – 19 November 1988[1]) was the 15th Chief Justice of India, serving from January 1977 to February 1978. Early life and education[edit] Born into a Deccani Muslim family, his father Mirza Samiullah Beg was the Chief Justice of Hyderabad State, making him an important figure in Hyderabad state affairs. He was the real uncle of internationally acclaimed beautician Shahnaz Husain. As was the case with many children of aristocracy in Hyderabad at the time, Mirza Hameedullah Beg attended St. George\'s Grammar School, where he earned a gold medal for securing first position in Senior Cambridge H.S.L.C. Examination. As India was still under heavy British influence, it was common for wealthy Indians to receive higher education in England, particularly when studying law. Thus, M.H. Beg joined the renowned Trinity College and Cambridge University in 1931, and earned Honours in Archaeological and Anthropological and Historical Triposes. He studied law, economics and politics at the London School of Economics. He joined the bar through the Honourable Society of Lincoln\'s Inn. He was called to the Bar in England in 1941. Judicial career[edit] After graduation, M.H. Beg returned to India to begin practising as an Advocate for the Allahabad High Court, at Allahabad and Meerut. From here, M.H. Beg began working up experience in the judicial system. In 1949, he enrolled as an Advocate of the Federal Court of India, and eventually he became an Advocate of the Supreme Court of India. After building up an extensive practice on all sides he became Standing Counsel to the U.P. Sunni Central Wakf Board and appeared frequently for Municipal bodies. Beg was raised to the Bench of the Allahabad High Court on 11 June 1963. As judge, he sat on the Criminal and Civil sides as well as on the Tax Bench. Later, he was appointed Company Judge and became in charge of the matrimonial and testamentary jurisdiction of the High Court from the middle of 1967 to 1970. Shortly after territories were redrawn and the state of Himachal Pradesh was established, M.H. Beg was appointed Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court in January 1971.[2] After a short term as Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court, Beg was elevated to Judge of the Supreme Court of India on 12 December 1971. Over the course of his Supreme Court tenure, Beg authored 194 judgments and sat on 562 benches. [3] By being Chief Justice of India, he also administered oath of office to 6th President of India Neelam Sanjiva Reddy. Habeas Corpus case[edit] Beg was also involved in the Habeas Corpus case. This landmark case in Indian democracy, Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla, came up in 1975 during the Indian Emergency. The legal question hinged on the citizen\'s right to judicial scrutiny for arrests under emergency. The five seniormost judges of the Supreme court heard the case, and four aligned with the government view that even the right to life stood suspended during emergency (only dissent was H. R. Khanna). In his April 1976 decision, Justice Beg observed: We understand that the care and concern bestowed by the state authorities upon the welfare of detenues [sic?] who are well housed, well fed and well treated, is almost maternal.[4] A few months later, in January 1977, M.H. Beg, who was junior to H. R. Khanna, was appointed Chief Justice of India by the Indira Gandhi government. This was against legal tradition, though it had started with A. N. Ray\'s appointment. This impingement into the independence of the judiciary was widely protested;[5] subsequent law ministers, particularly Shanti Bhushan, initiated a series of measures to bring judicial appointments within the power of the Chief Justice, and not the executive. After Mohammad Hidayatullah, Beg was the second Muslim Chief Justice in India. After a one-year term, Beg retired in February 1978. Subsequently, Beg served as chairman of the Minorities Commission of India.[6][7] Academics[edit] While practising as an Advocate, Beg took on various faculty positions teaching various subjects: Professor, Constitutional Law and Equity at Meerut College (1943–1946) Taught Law of Evidence, Human Law, and Ancient Law at Allahabad University(1946–1963) Standing Counsel to the Allahabad University Member of the International Law Association and of the World Association of Judges Since retirement, Beg has written two books discussing Muslim politics in India: Impact of Secularism on Life and Law, published in 1985 Human Rights and Asia, published in 1978 Awards[edit] 1988: Padma Vibhushan India\'s second highest civilian award for his contribution towards Law and Public Affairs References[edit] ^ George H.

As head of the Supreme Court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation of cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important matters of law.[1] In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India and the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the chief justice allocates all work to the other judges.[2] A new chief justice is appointed by the president of India with recommendations by the outgoing chief justice in consultation with other judges.[3] The chief justice serves in the role until they reach the age of sixty-five or are removed by the constitutional process of impeachment.[2] As per convention, the name suggested by the incumbent chief justice is almost always the next senior-most judge in the Supreme Court. This convention has been broken twice: in 1973, Justice A. N. Ray was appointed superseding three senior judges and in 1977, Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as the chief justice superseding Justice Hans Raj Khanna.[4] A total of 52 chief justices have served in the office since the Supreme Court of India superseded the Federal Court of India in 1950. Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud, the 16th chief justice, is the longest-serving chief justice, serving over seven years (February 1978 – July 1985), while Kamal Narain Singh, the 22nd chief justice, is the shortest-serving, for 17 days in 1991. As of 2024, there has been no woman who has served as chief justice of India.[5] The current and 52nd chief justice is B. R. Gavai who entered office on 14 May 2025.[6][7] He will have a term of 6 months which is due to end on 23 November 2025.[8] List of chief justices of the Federal Court of India[edit] The Federal Court of India came into being on 1 October 1937.[9] The seat of the court was in Delhi[10] and it functioned until the establishment of the Supreme Court of India on 28 January 1950. The first chief justice was Sir Maurice Gwyer.

Elected as an MP from 1978 to 2013, she was appointed as Iceland\'s Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security, serving from 1987 to 1994, and from 2007 until 2009. In 1994, when she lost a bid to head the Social Democratic Party, she raised her fist and declared ""Minn tími mun koma!"" (""My time will come!""), a phrase that became a popular Icelandic expression.[2][3] Later in 1994, she left the party and formed her own party, National Awakening (Þjóðvaki), with her as leader. The party received 7.1% of the popular vote in the 1995 parliamentary election and four elected MPs. In 1996 all of the MPs joined the Social Democratic Party. In the 1999 election, National Awakening ran with the newly formed Social Democratic Alliance. In 2000 the party officially merged with the Social Democratic Alliance. Jóhanna became prime minister on 1 February 2009, in a minority cabinet formed after the previous coalition was dissolved following the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis. Her coalition received a majority in the 2009 parliamentary election. She became Iceland\'s first female prime minister and the world\'s first openly LGBT head of government in modern times. Forbes listed her among the 100 most powerful women in the world in 2009.[4] She was a member of the Althing (Iceland\'s parliament) for Reykjavík constituencies from 1978 to 2013, winning re-election on eight successive occasions. In September 2012, Jóhanna announced she would not seek re-election and retired from politics as then-Iceland\'s longest serving member of Parliament.[5] Education and early career[edit] Jóhanna was born in Reykjavík. Her father was Sigurður Egill Ingimundarson.[6] She studied at the Commercial College of Iceland, a vocational high school operated by the Chamber of Commerce. After graduating with her commercial diploma in 1960, she worked as a flight attendant with Icelandic Airlines (a predecessor of Icelandair) from 1962 to 1971, and as an office manager from 1971 to 1978.[7] She was active in the trade union movement from early in her professional life, presiding over the Board of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association in 1966 and 1969 and over the Board of Svölurnar, Association of Former Stewardesses in 1975. She was also a member of the Board of the Commercial Workers\' Union from 1976 to 1983.[8] Political career[edit] Jóhanna was elected to the Althing in 1978 on the list of the Social Democratic Party for the Reykjavík constituency.[9] She enjoyed early success in her parliamentary career, serving as deputy speaker of the Althing in 1979 and in 1983–84. She was elected vice-chairperson of the Social Democratic Party in 1984, a post she held until 1993. She was also Minister of Social Affairs in four separate Cabinets from 1987 to 1994,[8] when she left the Social Democratic Party after losing the leadership contest to form a new party, National Awakening; the two parties remerged in 2000 to form the present Social Democratic Alliance. Her 1994 declaration Minn tími mun koma! (""My time will come!""), after she lost the contest for the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, has become an iconic phrase in the Icelandic language.[2][3] From 1994 to 2003, she was an active member of the opposition in the Althing, serving on numerous parliamentary committees. After the 2003 elections, which she contested from the Reykjavík South constituency (after the split of the old Reykjavík constituency), she was re-elected deputy speaker of the Althing. The 2007 elections, which she contested from the Reykjavík North constituency, saw the return of the Social Democratic Alliance to government in coalition with the Independence Party, and Jóhanna was named Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security.[9] Prime minister[edit] Icelandic financial crisis, protests and elections[edit] On 26 January 2009, Prime Minister Geir Haarde tendered the coalition government\'s resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson.[10][11] After talks with the leaders of the five parties represented in the Althing, the President asked the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement to form a new government and to prepare for elections in the spring.[12] Jóhanna was proposed as prime minister for the new government; two reasons for this were her popularity among the general public and her good relations with the Left-Green Movement. An opinion poll by Capacent Gallup in December 2008 found 73% approval of her actions as a minister, more than any other member of the cabinet: she was also the only minister to have improved her approval ratings over 2008.[13] The new government needed the support of the Progressive Party in the Althing.[14] Negotiations continued up to the evening of 31 January, and the new cabinet was appointed on 1 February. Independent polling showed that Jóhanna and Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, leader of the Left-Green Movement, the other party in the coalition government, enjoyed considerable support outside their own parties.[15] On 25 April 2009, a parliamentary election was held in Iceland,[16] following the protests now known as the Kitchenware Revolution[17] that resulted from the Icelandic financial crisis.[18][19][20][21] The Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, which formed the outgoing coalition government under Jóhanna, both made gains and together had an overall majority of seats in the Althing. The Progressive Party also made gains, and the new Citizens\' Movement, formed after the January 2009 protests, gained four seats. The Independence Party, which had been in power for eighteen years until January 2009, lost a third of its support and nine seats in the Althing. On 10 May 2009, the new government was announced, with Jóhanna staying on as prime minister.[22] Overcoming the financial crisis[edit] There were several referendums to decide about the Icesave Icelandic bank debts, center of the country\'s financial crisis. The first Icesave referendum (Icelandic: Þjóðaratkvæðagreiðsla um Icesave), was held on 6 March 2010.[23] After the referendum, new negotiations commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Althing agreed to a repayment deal to pay back the full amount starting in 2016, finalising before 2046, with a fixed interest rate of 3%.[24] The Icelandic president once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February, calling for a new referendum.[25][26] Thus, a second referendum would be held on 9 April 2011 also resulting in ""no"" victory with a lesser percentage.[27] After the referendum failed to pass, the British and Dutch governments said that they would take the case to the European courts.[28] At a session on 28 September 2010, the Althing voted 33–30 to indict the former prime minister Geir Haarde, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office.[29] He stood trial before the Landsdómur, a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office, used for the first time since it was established in the 1905 Constitution.[30] New Icelandic constitution process[edit] Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (second from right) and Jónína Leósdóttir (left), on an official visit to Slovenia Once in power, the left coalition led by Jóhanna—comprising the Social Democratic Alliance, the Left-Green Movement, the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party—inspired largely by the citizen protests, agreed to convene a constitutional assembly to discuss changes to the Constitution, in use since 1905.[31] Taking its cue from nationwide protests and lobbying efforts by civil organisations, the new governing parties decided that Iceland\'s citizens should be involved in creating a new constitution and started to debate a bill on 4 November 2009 about that purpose. Parallel to the protests and parliament deliverance, citizens started to unite in grassroots-based think-tanks. A National Forum was organised on 14 November 2009, Þjóðfundur 2009, in the form of an assembly of Icelandic citizens at the Laugardalshöll in Reykjavík, by a group of grassroots citizen movements collectively called ""the Anthill"". 1,500 people were invited to participate in the assembly; of these, 1,200 were chosen at random from the national registry. On 16 June 2010 the Constitutional Act was finally accepted by parliament and a new Forum was summoned.[32][33] The Constitutional Act prescribed that the participants of the Forum had to be randomly sampled from the National Population Register. The Forum 2010 came into being due to the efforts of both governing parties and the Anthill group. A seven-member Constitutional Committee, appointed by the parliament, was charged with the supervision of the forum and the presentation of its results, while the organization and facilitation of the National Forum 2010 was done by the Anthill group that had organized the first Forum 2009.[citation needed] The process continued in the election of 25 people of no political affiliation on 26 October 2010. The Supreme Court of Iceland later invalidated the results of the election on 25 January 2011 following complaints about several faults in how the election was conducted,[34][35] but the Parliament decided that it was the manner of the election, and not the results, that had been questioned, and also that those 25 elected candidates would be a part of a Constitutional Council and thus the Constitutional change went on.[36] On 29 July 2011 the draft was presented to the Parliament,[37] which finally agreed in a vote on 24 May 2012, with 35 in favor and 15 against, to organize an advisory referendum on the Constitutional Council\'s proposal for a new constitution no later than 20 October 2012. The only opposing parliament members were the former governing right party, the Independence Party. Also a proposed referendum on the discontinuing of accession talks with the European Union by some parliamentarians of the governing left coalition was rejected, with 34 votes against and 25 in favor.[38] Women\'s rights and ban on striptease[edit] In 2010, her government banned strip clubs, paying for nudity in restaurants, and other means of employers profiting from employees\' nudity – the first such ban in a Western democratic country. Jóhanna commented: ""The Nordic countries are leading the way on women\'s equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.""[39] Responding to the policy change radical feminist Julie Bindel, writing for The Guardian, stated that Iceland had become the most feminist country in the world.[40] Asked what the most important gender issue today is, she answered ""To fight the pay gap between men and women"".[41] Personal life[edit] Jóhanna married Þorvaldur Steinar Jóhannesson in 1970[42] and the couple had two sons named Sigurður Egill Þorvaldsson and Davíð Steinar Þorvaldsson (born 1972 and 1977).[42] After their divorce in 1987, she joined in a civil union with Jónína Leósdóttir (born 1954), an author and playwright, in 2002.[2][3][8] In 2010, when same-sex marriage was legalised in Iceland, Jóhanna and Jónína changed their civil union into a marriage, thus becoming one of the first same-sex married couples in Iceland.[43] In 2017, she released a biography entitled Minn tími (""My Time""). The biography covers one of the most contentious periods in Icelandic history – from the financial crash of autumn 2008, through protests and emergency elections the following year, and the difficult recovery period that followed leading Iceland\'s left wing government.[44][45] See also[edit] List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government List of the first LGBT holders of political offices List of openly LGBT heads of government References[edit] ^ This name is usually spelled in English-language press as Johanna Sigurdardottir. ^ a b c Popham, Peter (29 January 2009).

Elected as an MP from 1978 to 2013, she was appointed as Iceland\'s Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security, serving from 1987 to 1994, and from 2007 until 2009. In 1994, when she lost a bid to head the Social Democratic Party, she raised her fist and declared ""Minn tími mun koma!"" (""My time will come!""), a phrase that became a popular Icelandic expression.[2][3] Later in 1994, she left the party and formed her own party, National Awakening (Þjóðvaki), with her as leader. The party received 7.1% of the popular vote in the 1995 parliamentary election and four elected MPs. In 1996 all of the MPs joined the Social Democratic Party. In the 1999 election, National Awakening ran with the newly formed Social Democratic Alliance. In 2000 the party officially merged with the Social Democratic Alliance. Jóhanna became prime minister on 1 February 2009, in a minority cabinet formed after the previous coalition was dissolved following the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis. Her coalition received a majority in the 2009 parliamentary election. She became Iceland\'s first female prime minister and the world\'s first openly LGBT head of government in modern times. Forbes listed her among the 100 most powerful women in the world in 2009.[4] She was a member of the Althing (Iceland\'s parliament) for Reykjavík constituencies from 1978 to 2013, winning re-election on eight successive occasions. In September 2012, Jóhanna announced she would not seek re-election and retired from politics as then-Iceland\'s longest serving member of Parliament.[5] Education and early career[edit] Jóhanna was born in Reykjavík. Her father was Sigurður Egill Ingimundarson.[6] She studied at the Commercial College of Iceland, a vocational high school operated by the Chamber of Commerce. After graduating with her commercial diploma in 1960, she worked as a flight attendant with Icelandic Airlines (a predecessor of Icelandair) from 1962 to 1971, and as an office manager from 1971 to 1978.[7] She was active in the trade union movement from early in her professional life, presiding over the Board of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association in 1966 and 1969 and over the Board of Svölurnar, Association of Former Stewardesses in 1975. She was also a member of the Board of the Commercial Workers\' Union from 1976 to 1983.[8] Political career[edit] Jóhanna was elected to the Althing in 1978 on the list of the Social Democratic Party for the Reykjavík constituency.[9] She enjoyed early success in her parliamentary career, serving as deputy speaker of the Althing in 1979 and in 1983–84. She was elected vice-chairperson of the Social Democratic Party in 1984, a post she held until 1993. She was also Minister of Social Affairs in four separate Cabinets from 1987 to 1994,[8] when she left the Social Democratic Party after losing the leadership contest to form a new party, National Awakening; the two parties remerged in 2000 to form the present Social Democratic Alliance. Her 1994 declaration Minn tími mun koma! (""My time will come!""), after she lost the contest for the leadership of the Social Democratic Party, has become an iconic phrase in the Icelandic language.[2][3] From 1994 to 2003, she was an active member of the opposition in the Althing, serving on numerous parliamentary committees. After the 2003 elections, which she contested from the Reykjavík South constituency (after the split of the old Reykjavík constituency), she was re-elected deputy speaker of the Althing. The 2007 elections, which she contested from the Reykjavík North constituency, saw the return of the Social Democratic Alliance to government in coalition with the Independence Party, and Jóhanna was named Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security.[9] Prime minister[edit] Icelandic financial crisis, protests and elections[edit] On 26 January 2009, Prime Minister Geir Haarde tendered the coalition government\'s resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson.[10][11] After talks with the leaders of the five parties represented in the Althing, the President asked the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement to form a new government and to prepare for elections in the spring.[12] Jóhanna was proposed as prime minister for the new government; two reasons for this were her popularity among the general public and her good relations with the Left-Green Movement. An opinion poll by Capacent Gallup in December 2008 found 73% approval of her actions as a minister, more than any other member of the cabinet: she was also the only minister to have improved her approval ratings over 2008.[13] The new government needed the support of the Progressive Party in the Althing.[14] Negotiations continued up to the evening of 31 January, and the new cabinet was appointed on 1 February. Independent polling showed that Jóhanna and Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, leader of the Left-Green Movement, the other party in the coalition government, enjoyed considerable support outside their own parties.[15] On 25 April 2009, a parliamentary election was held in Iceland,[16] following the protests now known as the Kitchenware Revolution[17] that resulted from the Icelandic financial crisis.[18][19][20][21] The Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement, which formed the outgoing coalition government under Jóhanna, both made gains and together had an overall majority of seats in the Althing. The Progressive Party also made gains, and the new Citizens\' Movement, formed after the January 2009 protests, gained four seats. The Independence Party, which had been in power for eighteen years until January 2009, lost a third of its support and nine seats in the Althing. On 10 May 2009, the new government was announced, with Jóhanna staying on as prime minister.[22] Overcoming the financial crisis[edit] There were several referendums to decide about the Icesave Icelandic bank debts, center of the country\'s financial crisis. The first Icesave referendum (Icelandic: Þjóðaratkvæðagreiðsla um Icesave), was held on 6 March 2010.[23] After the referendum, new negotiations commenced. On 16 February 2011, the Althing agreed to a repayment deal to pay back the full amount starting in 2016, finalising before 2046, with a fixed interest rate of 3%.[24] The Icelandic president once again refused to sign the new deal on 20 February, calling for a new referendum.[25][26] Thus, a second referendum would be held on 9 April 2011 also resulting in ""no"" victory with a lesser percentage.[27] After the referendum failed to pass, the British and Dutch governments said that they would take the case to the European courts.[28] At a session on 28 September 2010, the Althing voted 33–30 to indict the former prime minister Geir Haarde, but not the other ministers, on charges of negligence in office.[29] He stood trial before the Landsdómur, a special court to hear cases alleging misconduct in government office, used for the first time since it was established in the 1905 Constitution.[30] New Icelandic constitution process[edit] Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (second from right) and Jónína Leósdóttir (left), on an official visit to Slovenia Once in power, the left coalition led by Jóhanna—comprising the Social Democratic Alliance, the Left-Green Movement, the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party—inspired largely by the citizen protests, agreed to convene a constitutional assembly to discuss changes to the Constitution, in use since 1905.[31] Taking its cue from nationwide protests and lobbying efforts by civil organisations, the new governing parties decided that Iceland\'s citizens should be involved in creating a new constitution and started to debate a bill on 4 November 2009 about that purpose. Parallel to the protests and parliament deliverance, citizens started to unite in grassroots-based think-tanks. A National Forum was organised on 14 November 2009, Þjóðfundur 2009, in the form of an assembly of Icelandic citizens at the Laugardalshöll in Reykjavík, by a group of grassroots citizen movements collectively called ""the Anthill"". 1,500 people were invited to participate in the assembly; of these, 1,200 were chosen at random from the national registry. On 16 June 2010 the Constitutional Act was finally accepted by parliament and a new Forum was summoned.[32][33] The Constitutional Act prescribed that the participants of the Forum had to be randomly sampled from the National Population Register. The Forum 2010 came into being due to the efforts of both governing parties and the Anthill group. A seven-member Constitutional Committee, appointed by the parliament, was charged with the supervision of the forum and the presentation of its results, while the organization and facilitation of the National Forum 2010 was done by the Anthill group that had organized the first Forum 2009.[citation needed] The process continued in the election of 25 people of no political affiliation on 26 October 2010. The Supreme Court of Iceland later invalidated the results of the election on 25 January 2011 following complaints about several faults in how the election was conducted,[34][35] but the Parliament decided that it was the manner of the election, and not the results, that had been questioned, and also that those 25 elected candidates would be a part of a Constitutional Council and thus the Constitutional change went on.[36] On 29 July 2011 the draft was presented to the Parliament,[37] which finally agreed in a vote on 24 May 2012, with 35 in favor and 15 against, to organize an advisory referendum on the Constitutional Council\'s proposal for a new constitution no later than 20 October 2012. The only opposing parliament members were the former governing right party, the Independence Party. Also a proposed referendum on the discontinuing of accession talks with the European Union by some parliamentarians of the governing left coalition was rejected, with 34 votes against and 25 in favor.[38] Women\'s rights and ban on striptease[edit] In 2010, her government banned strip clubs, paying for nudity in restaurants, and other means of employers profiting from employees\' nudity – the first such ban in a Western democratic country. Jóhanna commented: ""The Nordic countries are leading the way on women\'s equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.""[39] Responding to the policy change radical feminist Julie Bindel, writing for The Guardian, stated that Iceland had become the most feminist country in the world.[40] Asked what the most important gender issue today is, she answered ""To fight the pay gap between men and women"".[41] Personal life[edit] Jóhanna married Þorvaldur Steinar Jóhannesson in 1970[42] and the couple had two sons named Sigurður Egill Þorvaldsson and Davíð Steinar Þorvaldsson (born 1972 and 1977).[42] After their divorce in 1987, she joined in a civil union with Jónína Leósdóttir (born 1954), an author and playwright, in 2002.[2][3][8] In 2010, when same-sex marriage was legalised in Iceland, Jóhanna and Jónína changed their civil union into a marriage, thus becoming one of the first same-sex married couples in Iceland.[43] In 2017, she released a biography entitled Minn tími (""My Time""). The biography covers one of the most contentious periods in Icelandic history – from the financial crash of autumn 2008, through protests and emergency elections the following year, and the difficult recovery period that followed leading Iceland\'s left wing government.[44][45] See also[edit] List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government List of the first LGBT holders of political offices List of openly LGBT heads of government References[edit] ^ This name is usually spelled in English-language press as Johanna Sigurdardottir. ^ a b c Popham, Peter (29 January 2009).

She was the country’s first female prime minister and the world’s first openly gay head of government (Per-Kristian Foss served briefly as acting prime minister of Norway in 2002).Sigurðardóttir worked as a flight attendant for Loftleiðir Icelandic Airlines from 1962 to 1971, and she was an active labour union member, twice serving as chairman of the board of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association (1966, 1969). She took an office job in Reykjavík in 1971. While there she continued her association with organized labour, and she sat on the board of the Commercial Workers’ Union. In 1978 Sigurðardóttir was elected to the Althing (parliament) as a member of the Social Democratic Party, representing Reykjavík. She quickly gained a reputation as an advocate for social justice, and she called for the strengthening of Iceland’s welfare system. She was named minister of social affairs in 1987, a position she held until 1994, when she unsuccessfully campaigned for leadership of the Social Democratic Party. Sigurðardóttir responded to this setback by forming her own party, National Movement, which captured four seats in the subsequent parliamentary election. The two parties reconciled in 1999, when they joined with the Women’s Alliance and the People’s Alliance to contest that year’s election; in 2000 the coalition formally became the Social Democratic Alliance.By this time Sigurðardóttir had established herself as one of the leading personalities in Icelandic politics. She returned to the ministry of social affairs in 2007, and she emerged as a voice of calm in the wake of Iceland’s financial collapse in 2008. After the resignation of conservative Prime Minister Geir Haarde in January 2009, Sigurðardóttir led a coalition of Social Democrats and Left-Greens to form a caretaker minority government. On February 1, 2009, she was formally sworn in as Iceland’s prime minister. In the April elections the Social Democrats and Left-Greens won 34 seats, capturing a slim majority in the 63-member parliament. Shortly thereafter Sigurðardóttir announced that one of her top priorities as prime minister would be securing Iceland’s membership in the European Union. On June 27, 2010, the day that same-sex marriage became legal in Iceland, Sigurðardóttir and her partner Jónína Leósdóttir were married by means of a simple conversion of their registered partnership. During Sigurðardóttir’s tenure as prime minister, Iceland’s economy got back on sound footing after being rocked by the 2008 financial crisis. GDP had dropped by 6.5 percent and 4 percent in 2009 and 2010, respectively, but it bounced back to 3 percent growth in both 2011 and 2012. It also appeared as if Iceland would draft and adopt a new constitution during Sigurðardóttir’s time in office. An innovative process through which 25 Icelanders were selected from a pool of 525 citizens to draft the new constitution—relying on feedback through e-mail and social media—resulted in a document that was approved by some two-thirds of those who voted on it in a nonbinding referendum in October 2012. Once the new draft constitution reached the Althing, however, the process stalled, seemingly because of opposition to it by the Progressive and Independence parties. Sigurðardóttir chose to not run for reelection and watched as her ruling coalition lost 18 of its 34 seats in the 2013 election to cede power to the Progressive and Independence parties.Michael RayThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"", 'Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir Facts for Kids Clear Search Web Images Kimages Kpedia EspañolNEW Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir facts for kids Kids Encyclopedia FactsThis is an Icelandic name.

She made history as the prime minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013. Jóhanna was a member of the Althing (Iceland\'s parliament) for many years, from 1978 to 2013. She also served as Iceland\'s Minister of Social Affairs and Social Security twice. The first time was from 1987 to 1994, and then again from 2007 to 2009. In 2009, Jóhanna became Iceland\'s first female prime minister. She was also the world\'s first openly LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) head of government in modern times. Forbes magazine even named her one of the 100 most powerful women in the world in 2009. Contents Early Life and Work Political Journey Becoming Prime Minister Leading During the Financial Crisis New Constitution Efforts Promoting Women\'s Rights Personal Life See also Early Life and Work Jóhanna was born in Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Her father was Sigurður Egill Ingimundarson. She went to the Commercial College of Iceland, where she earned a diploma in 1960. After college, she worked as a flight attendant for Icelandic Airlines from 1962 to 1971. This airline later became Icelandair. From 1971 to 1978, she worked as an office manager. Jóhanna was also active in trade unions, which are groups that protect workers\' rights. She led the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association in 1966 and 1969. Political Journey Jóhanna was first elected to the Althing in 1978. She quickly became an important figure in parliament. She served as the deputy speaker of the Althing in 1979 and again from 1983 to 1984. She was also the Minister of Social Affairs in four different governments between 1987 and 1994. In 1994, she tried to become the leader of her political party, the Social Democratic Party, but she didn\'t win. After that, she famously declared, ""Minn tími mun koma!"" which means ""My time will come!"" This phrase became very well-known in Iceland. She then started her own party called National Awakening. Later, her party joined with others to form the Social Democratic Alliance. Becoming Prime Minister In January 2009, the previous government in Iceland resigned because of a big financial crisis. After this, Jóhanna was asked to lead a new government. People trusted her because she was very popular and had good relationships with other political parties. She became prime minister on 1 February 2009. Her government was a team-up between the Social Democratic Alliance and the Left-Green Movement. Leading During the Financial Crisis Iceland faced a big financial crisis around 2008. Many people protested, which led to the government changing. Jóhanna\'s new government worked to fix the country\'s economy. In 2009, a new election was held. Jóhanna\'s party and its partners won a majority of seats in the Althing. This meant they had strong support to continue leading Iceland. One of the challenges was dealing with the Icesave bank debts. There were two public votes, called referendums, in 2010 and 2011 about how to pay back these debts. Both times, the public voted ""no"" to the proposed repayment plans. New Constitution Efforts After Jóhanna\'s government came to power, they wanted to update Iceland\'s Constitution. They believed that citizens should be involved in this important process. Many citizens had already been protesting and asking for changes. So, the government decided to involve people directly. In 2009, a ""National Forum"" was held where 1,200 randomly chosen citizens discussed ideas for a new constitution. This led to a special ""Constitutional Council"" being formed. Twenty-five people, not connected to political parties, were chosen to draft a new constitution. In 2011, they presented their ideas to the parliament. In 2012, the parliament voted to hold a public vote on this new constitution draft. This showed a strong effort to make the government more open and responsive to its people. Promoting Women\'s Rights Jóhanna\'s government also took important steps for women\'s rights. ..... This was the first ban of its kind in a Western country. Jóhanna said that Nordic countries like Iceland are leaders in treating women equally. She believed that women should be seen as equal citizens, not as something to be sold. She also worked to close the pay gap between men and women. Personal Life Jóhanna married Þorvaldur Steinar Jóhannesson in 1970. They had two sons, Sigurður Egill Þorvaldsson and Davíð Steinar Þorvaldsson. They later divorced in 1987. In 2002, Jóhanna entered a civil union with Jónína Leósdóttir, who is an author. A civil union is a legal partnership similar to marriage. In 2010, when same-sex marriage became legal in Iceland, Jóhanna and Jónína changed their civil union into a marriage. They were one of the first same-sex married couples in Iceland. In 2017, Jóhanna wrote a book about her life called Minn tími (""My Time""). The book talks about her time leading Iceland, especially during the financial crisis and the protests that followed.

She was the first female chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. After the revocation of Article 370 of the constitution in August 2019, Mufti was detained without any charges at first and later under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.[2] Mufti was the first woman to hold the office of chief minister in the Jammu and Kashmir.[3] She formed a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir jointly with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She resigned in June 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition.[4] Mufti was the president of the PDP and was a member of the Indian parliament, representing Anantnag in the 16th Lok Sabha before she was sworn in as the chief minister of the Jammu and Kashmir. She also represented Anantnag in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004–09)[5] and has also been a Leader of Opposition in Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly. Early life[edit] She is the daughter of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Gulshan Ara,[6] born in 1959 in Akhran Nowpora, J&K, India. She graduated in English literature from Government College for Women in Jammu,[7] and has a law degree from the University of Kashmir.[8][9] Post 1989, she shifted to N. Delhi and joined the Bombay Mercantile Bank, after which she worked with East West Airlines, before moving back to J&K. Her ex-husband is a political analyst, an animal-rights activist, and was briefly with National Conference party.[1] She has two daughters, Iltija and Irtiqa.[10] Political career[edit] When elections for the state assembly were held in 1996, Mehbooba became one of the most popular members elected from Bijbehara on an Indian National Congress ticket.[11] Her father had returned to the Congress, which he had left in 1987, angry at the alliance that party had formed with its traditional rival in the state, the National Conference.[12] She later served as the leader of the opposition in the assembly, taking on the government of chief minister Farooq Abdullah with asperity.[13] She resigned her assembly seat and went on to contest the parliamentary elections in 1999 from Srinagar, where she lost to incumbent member Omar Abdullah. She won the Pahalgam seat in the state assembly from South Kashmir, defeating Rafi Ahmed Mir, when assembly elections were held again in 2002. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Anantnag seat in 2004 and 2014.[11] She defeated Mirza Mehboob Beg who was the incumbent MP in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections. After her father\'s death in January 2016, when he was heading the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, she took forward the same alliance with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time the BJP and the PDP formed a government in Jammu and Kashmir.[14][15][16] On 4 April 2016, she took the oath and became the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. On 25 June 2016, she won an Assembly seat in a by-election in Anantnag with the highest margin in any recent elections there and thereafter focussed on settling of Rohingyas.[17] On 19 June 2018, she resigned as chief minister of Kashmir.[18] Her government had been an alliance between the Peoples\' Democratic Party (PDP) and the BJP, but there was a rift in the alliance in February 2018, when two BJP ministers expressed public support for a man who was alleged to have raped and killed an eight-year-old girl in Kathua District.[18] The BJP\'s National General Secretary, Ram Madhav, announced the end of the alliance between the BJP and the PDP,[18] and said that it was because of the deteriorating security situation.[18][19] Mehbooba and the state government had tried suspending security operations for Ramadan, but the militants had not reciprocated,[19] and 30 people were killed during the ceasefire.[18] So the BJP withdrew from the alliance with the PDP so that the Indian government could get tough with the militants.[19] When the alliance between the PDP and the BJP ended, Mehbooba resigned as chief minister.[18] Mehbooba said ""the muscular policy will not work in Kashmir"".[18] She contested 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Anantnag seat but lost it to Hasnain Masoodi of National Conference,[20] and later also lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from Anantanag - Rajouri seat to Mian Altaf Ahmed Larvi of National Conference [1] with 2.3 lakh votes. Detention[edit] On 5 August 2019, she was detained by the Central government.[2] Her daughter Iltija Mufti took over her mother\'s Twitter account on the 46th day of detention.[21] In November, Iltija Mufti wrote a letter to the Srinagar Deputy Commissioner to shift her mother to a place better equipped for the valley\'s winter.[22] In February 2020 she was further detained under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.[23] She was released on 13 October 2020.[24] On 25 November 2020, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and People\'s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police and was not allowed to visit South Kashmir\'s Pulwama to meet the family of senior PDP leader Waheed Para, who was arrested by the National Investigating Agency earlier that week.[citation needed] Mufti said that her daughter Iltija Mufti has also been placed under house arrest.[25][26] See also[edit] Mehbooba Mufti ministry (2016–2018) Notes[edit] ^ Omar Abdullah as Chief Minister of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

She was the first female chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir. After the revocation of Article 370 of the constitution in August 2019, Mufti was detained without any charges at first and later under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.[2] Mufti was the first woman to hold the office of chief minister in the Jammu and Kashmir.[3] She formed a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir jointly with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She resigned in June 2018 after the BJP withdrew from the coalition.[4] Mufti was the president of the PDP and was a member of the Indian parliament, representing Anantnag in the 16th Lok Sabha before she was sworn in as the chief minister of the Jammu and Kashmir. She also represented Anantnag in the 14th Lok Sabha (2004–09)[5] and has also been a Leader of Opposition in Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly. Early life[edit] She is the daughter of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Gulshan Ara,[6] born in 1959 in Akhran Nowpora, J&K, India. She graduated in English literature from Government College for Women in Jammu,[7] and has a law degree from the University of Kashmir.[8][9] Post 1989, she shifted to N. Delhi and joined the Bombay Mercantile Bank, after which she worked with East West Airlines, before moving back to J&K. Her ex-husband is a political analyst, an animal-rights activist, and was briefly with National Conference party.[1] She has two daughters, Iltija and Irtiqa.[10] Political career[edit] When elections for the state assembly were held in 1996, Mehbooba became one of the most popular members elected from Bijbehara on an Indian National Congress ticket.[11] Her father had returned to the Congress, which he had left in 1987, angry at the alliance that party had formed with its traditional rival in the state, the National Conference.[12] She later served as the leader of the opposition in the assembly, taking on the government of chief minister Farooq Abdullah with asperity.[13] She resigned her assembly seat and went on to contest the parliamentary elections in 1999 from Srinagar, where she lost to incumbent member Omar Abdullah. She won the Pahalgam seat in the state assembly from South Kashmir, defeating Rafi Ahmed Mir, when assembly elections were held again in 2002. She was elected to the Lok Sabha from Anantnag seat in 2004 and 2014.[11] She defeated Mirza Mehboob Beg who was the incumbent MP in 2014 Lok Sabha Elections. After her father\'s death in January 2016, when he was heading the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir, she took forward the same alliance with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the second time the BJP and the PDP formed a government in Jammu and Kashmir.[14][15][16] On 4 April 2016, she took the oath and became the first woman Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. On 25 June 2016, she won an Assembly seat in a by-election in Anantnag with the highest margin in any recent elections there and thereafter focussed on settling of Rohingyas.[17] On 19 June 2018, she resigned as chief minister of Kashmir.[18] Her government had been an alliance between the Peoples\' Democratic Party (PDP) and the BJP, but there was a rift in the alliance in February 2018, when two BJP ministers expressed public support for a man who was alleged to have raped and killed an eight-year-old girl in Kathua District.[18] The BJP\'s National General Secretary, Ram Madhav, announced the end of the alliance between the BJP and the PDP,[18] and said that it was because of the deteriorating security situation.[18][19] Mehbooba and the state government had tried suspending security operations for Ramadan, but the militants had not reciprocated,[19] and 30 people were killed during the ceasefire.[18] So the BJP withdrew from the alliance with the PDP so that the Indian government could get tough with the militants.[19] When the alliance between the PDP and the BJP ended, Mehbooba resigned as chief minister.[18] Mehbooba said ""the muscular policy will not work in Kashmir"".[18] She contested 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Anantnag seat but lost it to Hasnain Masoodi of National Conference,[20] and later also lost the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from Anantanag - Rajouri seat to Mian Altaf Ahmed Larvi of National Conference [1] with 2.3 lakh votes. Detention[edit] On 5 August 2019, she was detained by the Central government.[2] Her daughter Iltija Mufti took over her mother\'s Twitter account on the 46th day of detention.[21] In November, Iltija Mufti wrote a letter to the Srinagar Deputy Commissioner to shift her mother to a place better equipped for the valley\'s winter.[22] In February 2020 she was further detained under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.[23] She was released on 13 October 2020.[24] On 25 November 2020, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and People\'s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti was detained by Jammu and Kashmir Police and was not allowed to visit South Kashmir\'s Pulwama to meet the family of senior PDP leader Waheed Para, who was arrested by the National Investigating Agency earlier that week.[citation needed] Mufti said that her daughter Iltija Mufti has also been placed under house arrest.[25][26] See also[edit] Mehbooba Mufti ministry (2016–2018) Notes[edit] ^ Omar Abdullah as Chief Minister of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
